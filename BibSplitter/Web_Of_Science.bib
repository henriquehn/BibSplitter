Abstract = {In this paper, we design a medium access control (MAC) layer prootocol
   for wireless body area networks (WBANs) to cope with inter-WBAN
   interference. Each WBAN consists of a coordinator and multiple sensor
   nodes. Interference happens when multiple nodes transmit to their
   coordinators at the same time. To avoid interference among WBANs,
   carrier sensing multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) is
   implemented at the coordinator level; while for communications within
   each WBAN, the coordinator uses beacon messages to centrally arrange all
   the transmissions to avoid collisions. In the proposed protocol, the
   coordinator adaptively adjusts its frame length based on its perceived
   interference level. By doing so, a WBAN can enjoy a high throughput
   under a light interference level, while giving other WBANs a fair share
   of channel access chance when the number of surrounding WBANs is large.
   We further design a sensing scheme to reduce the sensing power
   consumption for the sensor nodes and discuss how to extend the protocol
   for multi-channel and QoS support. Finally the simulation results verify
   the effectiveness of the proposed protocol.},

Title = {Hybrid Multi-Channel MAC Protocol for WBANs with Inter-WBAN Interference
   Mitigation},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Herein, we propose a hybrid multi-channel medium access control (HM-MAC)
   protocol for wireless body area networks (WBANs) that mitigates
   inter-WBAN interference significantly. In HM-MAC, a superframe consists
   of a random access phase and a scheduled access phase. That is, a
   carrier sensing multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) phase
   and a time division multiple access (TDMA) phase are included in a
   superframe. The random access phase allows higher-priority users to
   transmit data packets with low latency and high reliability. The
   retransmission of data packets is also performed in the random access
   phase. The periodic data are transmitted in the scheduled phase,
   resulting in no contention and high reliability. A channel selection
   algorithm is also proposed to avoid collision between neighboring WBANs.
   The HM-MAC protocol allows multiple transmissions simultaneously on
   different channels, resulting in high throughput and low collision. The
   sensor nodes update idle channels by listening to the beacon signal;
   consequently, the sensor nodes can change the working channel to reduce
   inter-WBAN interference. According to our simulation results, HM-MAC
   achieves a higher packet delivery ratio and higher throughput with lower
   energy consumption than the conventional scheme in multi-WBAN scenarios.
   HM-MAC also causes lower end-to-end delays for higher-priority users.},

Abstract = {Wireless body area network (WBAN) has witnessed significant attentions
   in the healthcare domain using biomedical sensor-based monitoring of
   heterogeneous nature of vital signs of a patient's body. The design of
   frequency band, MAC superframe structure, and slots allocation to the
   heterogeneous nature of the patient's packets have become the
   challenging problems in WBAN due to the diverse QoS requirements. In
   this context, this paper proposes an Energy Efficient Traffic
   Prioritization for Medium Access Control (EETP-MAC) protocol, which
   provides sufficient slots with higher bandwidth and guard bands to avoid
   channels interference causing longer delay. Specifically, the design of
   EETP-MAC is broadly divided in to four folds. Firstly, patient data
   traffic prioritization is presented with broad categorization including
   Non-Constrained Data (NCD), Delay-Constrained Data (DCD),
   Reliability-Constrained Data (RCD) and Critical Data (CD). Secondly, a
   modified superframe structure design is proposed for effectively
   handling the traffic prioritization. Thirdly, threshold based slot
   allocation technique is developed to reduce contention by effectively
   quantifying criticality on patient data. Forth, an energy efficient
   frame design is presented focusing on beacon interval, superframe
   duration, and packet size and inactive period. Simulations are performed
   to comparatively evaluate the performance of the proposed EETP-MAC with
   the state-of-the-art MAC protocols. The comparative evaluation attests
   the benefit of EETP-MAC in terms of efficient slot allocation resulting
   in lower delay and energy consumption.},

Title = {A Priority-Based Adaptive MAC Protocol for Wireless Body Area Networks},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2016},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In wireless body area networks (WBANs), various sensors and actuators
   are placed on/inside the human body and connected wirelessly. WBANs have
   specific requirements for healthcare and medical applications, hence,
   standard protocols like the IEEE 802.15.4 cannot fulfill all the
   requirements. Consequently, many medium access control (MAC) protocols,
   mostly derived from the IEEE 802.15.4 superframe structure, have been
   studied. Nevertheless, they do not support a differentiated quality of
   service (QoS) for the various forms of traffic coexisting in a WBAN. In
   particular, a QoS-aware MAC protocol is essential for WBANs operating in
   the unlicensed Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) bands, because
   different wireless services like Bluetooth, WiFi, and Zigbee may coexist
   there and cause severe interference. In this paper, we propose a
   priority-based adaptive MAC (PA-MAC) protocol for WBANs in unlicensed
   bands, which allocates time slots dynamically, based on the traffic
   priority. Further, multiple channels are effectively utilized to reduce
   access delays in a WBAN, in the presence of coexisting systems. Our
   performance evaluation results show that the proposed PA-MAC outperforms
   the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC and the conventional priority-based MAC in terms
   of the average transmission time, throughput, energy consumption, and
   data collision ratio.},

Abstract = {Health monitoring using biomedical sensors has witnessed significant
   attention in recent past due to the evolution of a new research area in
   sensor network known as Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs). In WBANs, a
   number of implantable, wearable, and off-body biomedical sensors are
   utilized to monitor various vital signs of patient's body for early
   detection, and medication of grave diseases. In literature, a number of
   Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols for WBANs have been suggested for
   addressing the unique challenges related to reliability, delay,
   collision and energy in the new research area. The design of MAC
   protocols is based on multiple access techniques. Understanding the
   basis of MAC protocol designs for identifying their design objectives in
   broader perspective, is a quite challenging task. In this context, this
   paper qualitatively reviews MAC protocols for WBANs. Firstly, 802.15.4
   and 802.15.6 based MAC Superframe structures are investigated focusing
   on design objectives. Secondly, different multiple access techniques
   such as TDMA, CSMA/CA, Slotted Aloha and Hybrid are explored in terms of
   design goals. Thirdly, a two-layered taxonomy is presented for MAC
   protocols. First layer classification is based on multiple access
   techniques, whereas second layer classification is based on design
   objectives and characteristics of MAC protocols. Critical and
   qualitative analysis is carried out for each considered MAC protocol.
   Comparative study of different MAC protocols is also performed. Finally,
   some open research challenges in the area are identified with initial
   research directions.},

Abstract = {In this study, Random Contention-based Resource Allocation (RACOON)
   medium access control (MAC) protocol is proposed to support the quality
   of service (QoS) for multi-user mobile wireless body area networks
   (WBANs). Different from existing QoS designs that focus on a single
   WBAN, a multiuser WBAN QoS should further consider both inter-WBAN
   interference and inter-WBAN priorities. Similar problems have been
   studied in both overlapped wireless local area networks (WLANs) and
   Bluetooth piconets that need QoS supports. However, these solutions are
   designed for non-medical transmissions that do not consider any priority
   scheme for medical applications. Most importantly, these studies focus
   on only static or low mobility networks. Network mobility of WBANs will
   introduce unnecessary inter-network collisions and energy waste, which
   are not considered by these solutions. The proposed multiuser-QoS
   protocol, RACOON, simultaneously satisfies the inter WBAN QoS
   requirements and overcomes the performance degradation caused by WBAN
   mobility. Simulation results verify that RACOON provides better latency
   and energy control, as compared with WBAN QoS protocols without
   considering the inter-WBAN requirements.},

Abstract = {Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) designed for medical, sports, and
   entertainment applications, have drawn the attention of academia and
   industry alike. A WBAN is a special purpose network, designed to operate
   autonomously to connect various medical sensors and appliances, located
   inside and/or outside of a human body. This network enables physicians
   to remotely monitor vital signs of patients and provide real time
   feedback for medical diagnosis and consultations. The WBAN system can
   offer two significant advantages: patient mobility due to their use of
   portable monitoring devices and a location independent monitoring
   facility. With its appealing dimensions, it brings about a new set of
   challenges, which we do not normally consider in such small sensor
   networks. It requires a scalable network in terms of heterogeneous data
   traffic, low power consumption of sensor nodes, integration in and
   around the body networking and coexistence. This work presents a medium
   access control protocol for WBAN which tries to overcome the
   aforementioned challenges. We consider the use of multiple beam adaptive
   arrays (MBAA) at BAN Coordinator (BAN\_C) node. When used as a BAN\_C,
   an MBAA can successfully receive two or more overlapping packets at the
   same time. Each beam captures a different packet by automatically
   pointing its pattern toward one packet while annulling other contending
   packets. This paper describes how an MBAA can be integrated into a
   single hope star topology as a BAN\_C. Simulation results show the
   performance of our proposed protocol.},

Abstract = {This paper considers the internetwork interference problem in
   environments with multiple wireless body area networks (WBANs). We
   propose an asynchronous internetwork interference avoidance scheme
   (abbreviated as AIIA), which is based on the hybrid multiple access of
   carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) and
   time division multiple access (TDMA). In AIIA, the gateway device of
   each WBAN maintains a table, called an AIIA table, which includes the
   timing offset and TDMA transmission schedule information corresponding
   to the interfering WBANs. By referring to the table, the conflicting
   TDMA schedule can be checked and updated by itself, in asynchronous and
   distributed manners. Extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate
   the feasibility and effectiveness of AIIA.},

Abstract = {The evolution of wireless body area network (WBAN) has changed the human
   life for its applications in the field of health care, fitness,
   entertainment, sports, etc. However, two of the major challenges in the
   design of WBAN are energy efficiency and guaranteeing QoS. The
   introduction of multichannel scheme has reduced the delay and increase
   the throughput by allowing parallel transmission in the WBANs and
   biosensors. In this paper, we propose time-sharing multichannel MAC for
   wireless body area network with an intention for real time and
   guaranteed delivery of emergency data and maximize energy efficiency.
   The objective is to design an efficient time-sharing multichannel MAC
   protocol for WBANs for energy-efficient transmission with low
   interference. Each node has been statically allocated to the time slots
   and channels so that they can wake up at their time slots and transmit
   their data. The proposed method is simulated using Castalia to study and
   compare its performance with its counterparts. The simulation results
   reveal that the proposed protocol works better than the existing methods
   in terms of delay, throughput and energy efficiency.},

Journal = {EGYPTIAN INFORMATICS JOURNAL},

Abstract = {Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) healthcare application is a group of
   heterogeneous-natured Bio-Medical Sensor Nodes (BMSNs) used to sense and
   monitor a patient's vital signs, in the long run, under natural
   physiological conditions, without affecting the regular activities.
   Heterogeneous-natured BMSNs demand prioritized channel access during
   contention access phases to transmit data or allocate time slots in
   contention-free phases. Thus, contention-based prioritization of
   heterogeneous traffic is required in WBANs. Therefore, many researchers
   have considered and presented various traffic-priority Medium Access
   Control (MAC) protocols. This paper provides a thematic review of
   contention-based traffic priority MAC protocols in WBANs. Slotted
   Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) scheme in
   beacon-enabled modes of IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.15.6 MACs is also
   analyzed regarding contention-based traffic prioritization. In addition,
   a critical and comparative analysis of existing contention-based traffic
   priority MAC protocols is obtained. A hierarchy of contention-based
   traffic priority MAC protocols is proposed. This review on
   contention-based traffic priority MAC protocols in WBANs extends the
   body of knowledge. This paper, therefore, serves as the first and
   enhances the concept of contention-based traffic prioritization at the
   MAC layer in WBANs. We have confidence that this paper will stimulate a
   better way of solving the contention-based traffic prioritization
   problem.},

Title = {Link Scheduling Algorithm with Interference Prediction for Multiple
   Mobile WBANs},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2017},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {As wireless body area networks (WBANs) become a key element in
   electronic healthcare (e-healthcare) systems, the coexistence of
   multiple mobile WBANs is becoming an issue. The network performance is
   negatively affected by the unpredictable movement of the human body. In
   such an environment, inter-WBAN interference can be caused by the
   overlapping transmission range of nearby WBANs. We propose a link
   scheduling algorithm with interference prediction (LSIP) for multiple
   mobile WBANs, which allows multiple mobile WBANs to transmit at the same
   time without causing inter-WBAN interference. In the LSIP, a superframe
   includes the contention access phase using carrier sense multiple access
   with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) and the scheduled phase using time
   division multiple access (TDMA) for non-interfering nodes and
   interfering nodes, respectively. For interference prediction, we define
   a parameter called interference duration as the duration during which
   disparate WBANs interfere with each other. The Bayesian model is used to
   estimate and classify the interference using a signal to interference
   plus noise ratio (SINR) and the number of neighboring WBANs. The
   simulation results show that the proposed LSIP algorithm improves the
   packet delivery ratio and throughput significantly with acceptable
   delay.},

Abstract = {Recently, the use of wireless body area networks (WBAN) has been
   increasing rapidly in medical healthcare applications. WBANs consist of
   smart nodes that can be used to sense and transmit vital data such as
   heart rate, temperature and ECG from a human body to a medical centre.
   WBANs depend on limited resources such as energy and bandwidth. In order
   to utilise these resources efficiently, a very well organized medium
   access control (MAC) protocol must be considered. In this paper, a new,
   adaptive and energy-efficient MAC protocol, entitled isMAC, is proposed
   for WBANs. The proposed MAC is based on multi-channel communication and
   aims to prolong the network lifetime by effectively employing (i) a
   collision prevention mechanism, (ii) a coordinator node (WCN) selection
   algorithm and (iii) a transmission power adjustment approach. The isMAC
   protocol has been developed and modelled, by using OPNET Modeler
   simulation software. It is based on a networking scenario that requires
   especially high data rates such as ECG, for performance evaluation
   purposes. Packet delay, network throughput and energy consumption have
   been chosen as performance metrics. The comparison between the
   simulation results of isMAC and classical IEEE 802.15.4 (ZigBee)
   protocol shows that isMAC significantly outperforms IEEE 802.15.4 in
   terms of packet delay, throughput and energy consumption.},

Abstract = {Wireless body area networks (WBANs) support the inter-operability of
   biomedical sensors and medical institutions with convenience and
   high-efficiency, which makes it an appropriate solution for the
   pervasive healthcare. Typically, WBANs comprise in-body or around-body
   sensor nodes for collecting data of physiological feature. Therefore,
   the efficient medium access control (MAC) protocol is a crucial
   paramount to coordinate these devices and forward data to the medical
   center in an efficient and reliable way. However, the extensive use of
   wireless channel and coexistence of WBANs may result in inevitable
   interference which will cause performance degradation. Besides,
   contention-based access in single channel in WBANs is less efficient for
   dense medical traffic on account of large packet delay, energy
   consumption and low priority starvation. To address these issues above,
   we propose a multi-channel MAC (MC-MAC) scheme to obtain better network
   performance. Considering the characteristic and emergency degree of
   medical traffic, we introduce a novel channel mapping and selection
   mechanism, cooperating with conflict avoidance strategy, to organize
   nodes to access available channels without collisions. In addition, we
   have evaluated the performance of MC-MAC and the standard IEEE 802.15.6
   via simulation and hardware test. The test is conducted by hardware
   platform based on prototype system of WBANs. Both of the analysis and
   simulation results show that MC-MAC outperforms the IEEE 802.15.6 in
   terms of packet delay, throughput, packet error rate and frame error
   rate.},

Abstract = {Currently, wireless body area networks (WBANs) are effectively used for
   health monitoring services. However, in cases where WBANs are densely
   deployed, interference among WBANs can cause serious degradation of
   network performance and reliability. Inter-WBAN interference can be
   reduced by scheduling the communication links of interfering WBANs. In
   this paper, we propose an interference-aware traffic-priority-based link
   scheduling (ITLS) algorithm to overcome inter-WBAN interference in
   densely deployed WBANs. First, we model a network with multiple WBANs as
   an interference graph where node-level interference and traffic priority
   are taken into account. Second, we formulate link scheduling for
   multiple WBANs as an optimization model where the objective is to
   maximize the throughput of the entire network while ensuring the traffic
   priority of sensor nodes. Finally, we propose the ITLS algorithm for
   multiple WBANs on the basis of the optimization model. High spatial
   reuse is also achieved in the proposed ITLS algorithm. The proposed ITLS
   achieves high spatial reuse while considering traffic priority, packet
   length, and the number of interfered sensor nodes. Our simulation
   results show that the proposed ITLS significantly increases spatial
   reuse and network throughput with lower delay by mitigating inter-WBAN
   interference.},

Abstract = {Wireless sensor network (WSN) is the promising technology that is being
   used for several applications in multiple fields. Advancements of WSN
   have made it possible to deploy the sensors in several fields (e.g.
   battle, environment-monitoring, surveillance, industry, health etc.)
   However, existing approaches experience the severe security threats in
   the field of WSNs particularly in the wireless body area networks
   (WBANs). These security threats are observed at the all layers. However,
   Medium Access Control (MAC) sub-layer faces more challenges as compared
   with other layers because of radio that consumes more energy resources.
   Thus, any possible attack over the MAC makes the slow down working
   process of WBANs. There are several well-known attacks that cause the
   additional energy consumption observed at the MAC layer in WBANs. These
   attacks involve the collision, denial of sleep, and selfish attack. The
   collision attack and denial of sleep attacks are researched and handled
   for MAC over the WBANs. However, selfish attack is not properly
   addressed. In this paper, we propose a selfish detection medium access
   control (SDMAC) algorithm against selfish attack in WBAN. Here the
   adversary nodes have advantage over legitimate nodes on MAC protocols
   that uses the resources wrongly, which leads to energy consumption in
   sensor nodes, proposed algorithm detects the fake node and blocks the
   unusual activities. In this case, network performance is improved after
   applying this proposed algorithm. To validate the performance of the
   proposed algorithm, the simulation is conducted using NS3. Based on the
   simulation results, we demonstrate that our proposed SDMAC outperforms
   other known existing protocols from energy efficiency and bandwidth
   reduction perspective.},

Abstract = {Medium access control protocols based on time division multiple access
   (TDMA) can improve the reliability and efficiency of wireless body area
   network (WBAN). However, traditional static TDMA techniques adopted by
   IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.15.6 do not sufficiently consider the channel
   status or the buffer requirements of the nodes within heterogeneous
   contexts. Although there are some solutions that have been proposed to
   alleviate the effect of the deep fade in WBAN channel by adopting
   dynamic slot allocation, these solutions still suffer from some
   reliability and energy efficiency issues and they do not avoid channel
   deep fading. This paper presents two novel and generic TDMA based
   techniques to improve WBAN reliability and energy efficiency. Both
   techniques synchronize nodes adaptively while tackling their channel and
   buffer status in normal and emergency contexts. Extensive simulation
   experiments using various traffic rates and time slot lengths
   demonstrate that the proposed techniques improve the reliability and the
   energy efficiency compared to IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.15.6 in both
   situations, the normal and emergency contexts. This improvement has been
   achieved in terms of packet loss, up to 90\%, and energy consumption, up
   to 13\%, confirming the significant enhancements made by the developed
   scheduling techniques.},

Abstract = {The increasing use of wireless networks and the constant miniaturization
   of electrical devices has empowered the development of Wireless Body
   Area Networks (WBANs). In these networks various sensors are attached on
   clothing or on the body or even implanted under the skin. The wireless
   nature of the network and the wide variety of sensors offer numerous
   new, practical and innovative applications to improve health care and
   the Quality of Life. The sensors of a WBAN measure for example the
   heartbeat, the body temperature or record a prolonged electrocardiogram.
   Using a WBAN, the patient experiences a greater physical mobility and is
   no longer compelled to stay in the hospital. This paper offers a survey
   of the concept of Wireless Body Area Networks. First, we focus on some
   applications with special interest in patient monitoring. Then the
   communication in a WBAN and its positioning between the different
   technologies is discussed. An overview of the current research on the
   physical layer, existing MAC and network protocols is given. Further,
   cross layer and quality of service is discussed. As WBANs are placed on
   the human body and often transport private data, security is also
   considered. An overview of current and past projects is given. Finally,
   the open research issues and challenges are pointed out.},

Abstract = {Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) are wireless sensor networks that
   monitor the physiological and contextual data of the human body. Nodes
   in a WBAN communicate using short-range and low-power transmissions to
   minimize any impact on the human body's health and mobility. These
   transmissions thus become subject to failures caused by radiofrequency
   interference or body mobility. Additionally, WBAN applications typically
   have timing constraints and carry dynamic traffic, which can change
   depending on the physiological conditions of the human body. Several
   approaches for the Medium Access Control (MAC) sublayer have been
   proposed to improve the reliability and efficiency of the WBANs. This
   paper proposes and uses a systematic literature review (SLR) method to
   identify, classify, and statistically analyze the published works with
   MAC approaches for WBAN efficiency and reliability under dynamic network
   traffic, radiofrequency interference, and body mobility. In particular,
   we extend a traditional SLR method by adding a new step to select
   publications based on qualitative parameters. As a result, we identify
   the challenges and proposed solutions, highlight advantages and
   disadvantages, and suggest future works.},

Abstract = {Advances in wireless sensor and internet technologies has rapidly
   increased the prevalence of remote health monitoring using wireless body
   area networks (WBAN). However, it turns out that WBAN pervasiveness
   draws attention to address the data transmission challenges. Due to the
   limited bandwidth in the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band
   , WBAN performance degrades in parallel with the increasing number of
   active devices sharing the same network infrastructure. As a result,
   during carrier sense the increasing device density impedes the
   synchronization mechanism that raises packet collision probabilities in
   the transmission channel. In this view, access to the transmission
   channel for health care applications in coexisting WBANs is limited, and
   the transmission of aperiodic data becomes unreliable. Therefore, in
   this article, we propose performance improvement for coexisting WBANs
   through transmission prioritization and adaptive channel access
   mechanisms. We categorize user data into classes and implement
   transmission prioritization scheme that considers data category, device
   synchronization, dynamic clear channel assessment (DCCA), backoff range
   adaptation, and packet retransmission trials in stationary and mobile
   networks. The simulation results show the performance of the proposed
   model's carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA-CA)
   for collocated WBANs in terms of throughput, delay, and packet delivery
   ratio outperform the conventional IEEE 802.15.4 and the transmission
   scheme applied in Traffic Class Prioritization Medium Access Control
   (TCP-MAC) protocols.},

Title = {On the Performance of LoRa Empowered Communication for Wireless Body
   Area Networks},
Journal = {IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {5},
Pages = {2942-2957},
Abstract = {To remotely monitor the physiological status of the human body, long
   range (LoRa) communication has been considered as an eminently suitable
   candidate for wireless body area networks (WBANs). Typically, a
   Rayleigh-lognormal fading channel is encountered by the LoRa links of
   the WBAN. In this context, we characterize the performance of the LoRa
   system in WBAN scenarios with an emphasis on the physical (PHY) layer
   and medium access control (MAC) layer in the face of Rayleigh-lognormal
   fading channels and the same spreading factor interference.
   Specifically, closed-form approximate bit error probability (BEP)
   expressions are derived for the LoRa system. The results show that
   increasing the spreading factor (SF) and reducing the interference
   efficiently mitigate the shadowing effects. Moreover, in the quest for
   the most suitable MAC protocol for LoRa based WBANs, three MAC protocols
   are critically appraised, namely the pure ALOHA, slotted ALOHA, and
   carrier-sense multiple access. The coverage probability, energy
   efficiency, throughput, and system delay of the three MAC protocols are
   analyzed in Rayleigh-lognormal fading channel. Furthermore, the
   performance of the equal-interval-based and equal-area-based schemes is
   analyzed to guide the choice of the SF. Our simulation results confirm
   the accuracy of the mathematical analysis, and provide some useful
   insights for the future design of LoRa based WBANs on how to achieve the
   desired performance requirements for different conditions (i.e.,
   different network radii and average numbers of end-devices) by using
   different SF allocation schemes and MAC protocols.},

Abstract = {Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) have been developed as the
   human-body monitoring systems to predict, diagnose, and treat diseases.
   Since the signal transmission in WBANs takes place in or around the
   human body the channel fading significantly affects packet error rate
   and overal network performance. In this work, we discuss the channel
   models and error performance formalization for WBANs. In the first phase
   of this work, we study channel fading models for WBANs. In the second
   phase, we survey the models which calculate the error performance
   metrics in WBANs. We select most appropriate error models to design and
   develop the error performance evaluation models for IEEE 802.15.6-based
   WBANs and show how to integrate them with the error model in Medium
   Access Control (MAC). We then discuss integrated PHY and MAC error

Abstract = {With the continuous developments in wireless sensor networks technology,
   health care market starts relying on it. The need to monitor patients or
   the ageing populations makes the technology more dependable in
   comparison with the traditional wired connections. The networks can be
   formed by the wireless sensors attached on or inside the patient's body,
   termed as Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN), and help the remote
   observer, i.e. doctor, nurse or health care center, to monitor the
   continuous behavior of a patient either at home or in hospital. In all
   such monitoring, the transfer of all disease related data to remote
   observer is highly important due to life threatening situations. To
   achieve this efficiently, communication between the patient and the
   health care center. Being a wireless medium of communication, energy
   efficiency is very important during the course of reliable
   communication. Existing research on medium access control (MAC) there
   must be reliable aims to improve the energy efficiency of battery
   powered device. In this paper, a time division multiple access (TDMA)
   based MAC protocol specially designed for WBAN is proposed. Data
   dissemination with dynamic timeline (DT-MAC) aims to efficiently use the
   bandwidth of the WBAN network focusing the management of bandwidth
   wastage as well as the collision and interference of data in an energy
   efficient manner.},

Abstract = {Advancements in the low power wireless sensor network design gave the
   e-healthcare systems a new dimension, specifically to Wireless Body Area
   Networks (WBANs). These technological developments benefits in a wide
   range of medical applications starting from simple physiological

   Mostly the emergency event communication plays a vital role in critical

   Wireless Body Area Networks With Unknown Dynamics},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Volume = {4},
Pages = {2935-2951},
Abstract = {This paper presents an adaptive interference mitigation scheme for
   multiple coexisting wireless body area networks (WBANs) based on social
   interaction. The proposed scheme considers the mobility of nodes within
   each WBAN as well as the relative movement of WBANs with respect to each
   other. With respect to these mobile scenarios traffic load, signal
   strength, and the density of sensors in a WBAN are incorporated to
   optimize transmission time with synchronous and parallel transmissions
   to significantly reduce the radio interference and energy consumption of
   nodes. This approach leads to higher packet delivery ratio (PDR) and
   longer network lifetime even with nodes dynamically moving into and out
   of each others interference region. We make channel assignment more
   energy-efficient and further reduce power consumption using transmit
   power control with simple channel prediction. Simulation results show
   that our approach maintains optimum spatial reuse with a range of
   channel dynamics within, and between, coexisting BANs. This protocol
   based on social interaction is shown to mitigate interference and
   minimize power consumption, and increase the spatial reuse and PDR of
   each WBAN, while increasing network lifetime. In the context of the
   adaptive interference mitigation scheme proposed, this paper also
   reviews the state of the art in literature on mobility, MAC layer, and
   power control solutions for WBANs, as well as providing a summary of
   interference mitigation schemes previously applied for the coexistence
   of WBANs.},

Abstract = {The newly emerging wireless body area networks (WBANs) are intended to
   support both medical applications and consumer electronic (CE)
   applications. These two types of applications present diverse service
   requirements. To satisfy both medical and CE applications with a uniform
   medium access control (MAC) protocol becomes a new challenge for the
   WBAN. Addressing this problem, a priority-guaranteed MAC protocol is
   proposed in this paper. In this protocol, data channels are separated
   from control channels to support collision-free high data rate
   communication for CE applications. Priority-specific control channels
   are adopted to provide priority guarantee to life-critical medical
   applications. Traffic-specific data channels are deployed to improve
   resource efficiency and latency performance. Moreover, in order to
   further minimize energy consumption and access latency, an asynchronous
   wakeup trigger mode is proposed as an enhancement to the priority
   traffic. Monte Carlo simulations are carried out for performance
   evaluation. As compared with IEEE 802.15.4 MAC and its improved
   versions, the priority-guaranteed MAC demonstrates significant
   improvements on throughput and energy efficiency with a tolerable
   penalty on latency performance of bursty traffic in CE applications.
   Therefore, the customized priority-guaranteed MAC satisfies the service
   requirements of WBAN by making tradeoff among the performances of
   different applications.},

Abstract = {Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) offer many new promising
   applications in the area of remote health monitoring. In WBANs, sensor
   nodes deployed on a human body often exhibit high mobility patterns due
   to body posture movement. In a prior work, a Cross-layer Opportunistic
   MAC/Routing (COMR) protocol has been proposed for multi-hop WBAN but the
   evaluation was made using a static network topology. As an extension, in
   this work the performance of COMR protocol is investigated taking into
   account node's mobility with different speeds depending on body
   positions. The impacts of varying payload sizes are evaluated for both
   COMR and Simple Opportunistic Routing (SOR) protocols using a mobility
   model in two scenarios: standing and walking. Simulation results exhibit
   that COMR performs better than SOR in terms of reliability, network
   lifetime, end-to-end (ETE) delay and energy efficiency.},

Abstract = {Wireless body area networks (WBANs), as an important part of the
   Internet of things and sensor networks, are becoming more important in
   health monitoring and entertainment services. The sensor nodes in these
   applications need to transmit information data to personal station and
   receive control information from personal station to adjust working
   modes. However, unlike an easily rechargeable personal station, body
   sensor nodes suffer from energy shortages, which affect the nodes'
   lifetimes. To solve this problem, we design a novel medium access
   control (MAC) layer protocol to enhance the energy efficiency and extend
   the lifetime of body sensor nodes in WBANs. The proposed protocol
   utilizes a hybrid scheme by taking advantage of carrier-sense multiple
   accesses with the collision avoidance and time division multiple access
   schemes. In addition, we allocate the main transmission overhead at the
   personal station side and design a novel awaiting order state for sensor
   nodes to improve energy efficiency. Also, the analysis and simulation
   results demonstrate that the proposed protocol can provide a 6\% to 15\%
   decrease in energy consumption from other protocols.},

Abstract = {In healthcare domain, Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) has transpired
   as a prominent technology which is capable of providing better methods
   of real time patient health monitoring at hospitals, asylums and even at
   their homes. In recent times, WBAN has gained great interest and proved
   one of the most explored technologies by health care facilities because
   of its vital role and wide range of application in clinical sciences.
   WBAN involve communication between very small sensor nodes with
   frequently changing environment, hence lots of issues still need to be
   addressed. Some of the major issues are Physical layer issues,
   interoperability\&mobility issue, reliability, resource management,

Abstract = {With the promising applications in e-Health and entertainment services,
   wireless body area network (WBAN) has attracted significant interest.
   One critical challenge for WBAN is to track and maintain the quality of
   service (QoS), e.g., delivery probability and latency, under the dynamic
   environment dictated by human mobility. Another important issue is to
   ensure the energy efficiency within such a resource-constrained network.
   In this paper, a new medium access control (MAC) protocol is proposed to
   tackle these two important challenges. We adopt a TDMA-based protocol
   and dynamically adjust the transmission order and transmission duration
   of the nodes based on channel status and application context of WBAN.
   The slot allocation is optimized by minimizing energy consumption of the
   nodes, subject to the delivery probability and throughput constraints.
   Moreover, we design a new synchronization scheme to reduce the
   synchronization overhead. Through developing an analytical model, we
   analyze how the protocol can adapt to different latency requirements in
   the healthcare monitoring service. Simulations results show that the
   proposed protocol outperforms CA-MAC and IEEE 802.15.6 MAC in terms of
   QoS and energy efficiency under extensive conditions. It also
   demonstrates more effective performance in highly heterogeneous WBAN.},

Abstract = {Over the past decade, advances in electronics, computer science, and
   wireless technologies have brought Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN)
   into many interesting applications. Particularly for the healthcare
   application, reliability is considered as a very important aspect for
   WBAN. Being the main focus of this paper, we aim at improving
   reliability by reducing the collision rate and increasing the packet
   delivery ratio. We also strive to enhance the performance in terms of
   throughput in the WBAN while maintaining message latency at a reasonable
   level. In an effort to achieve these goals, we introduce a new
   cross-layer fuzzy logic based backoff mechanism. Through this method,
   instead of relying merely on Medium Access Control (MAC), information
   from physical and application layers will be exploited as well.
   Moreover, since independent decision making is supported by each sensor
   without relying on any coordinating devices, communication in the WBAN
   becomes very flexible. Specifically, rather than determining Backoff
   Exponent (BE) in IEEE 802.15.4 through a blind try-and-error process,
   the proposed fuzzy logic system determines the BE by considering both
   the current channel condition and application requirements. This feature
   gives the proposed system a higher level of adaptability. The simulation
   results clearly show noticeable improvement in reliability and
   performance without significantly increasing the message latency.},

Abstract = {IEEE 802.15.6 is a wireless body area network (WBAN) standard proposed
   to facilitate the exponentially growing interest in the field of health
   monitoring. This standard is flexible and outlines multiple basic
   medium-access control (MAC) protocols that are contention based and
   collision free to meet the WBAN quality-of-service (QoS) challenges.
   Typically, current research trends in WBAN MAC focus on designing a
   hybrid MAC that is a combination of basic MAC protocols. In this paper,
   we provide a first detailed survey of existing hybrid MAC protocols
   based on the IEEE 802.15.6, which would be useful for the related
   research community. First, this paper lists the design challenges of a
   WBAN MAC. Second, it highlights the significance of hybrid MAC protocols
   in meeting the design challenges while comparing them to standard MAC
   protocols. Third, a critical and thorough comparison of existing hybrid
   MAC protocols is presented in terms of network QoS and WBAN specific
   parameters. Finally, we identify key open research areas that are often
   neglected in hybrid MAC design and further propose some possible
   directions for future research.},

Abstract = {The application of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology in modern
   healthcare environment has given rise to a new paradigm known as
   healthcare IoT. The wireless body area network (WBAN) is one of the
   basic building blocks of IoT-based healthcare system, comprising many
   wearable (on-body) and implant (in-body) sensors placed in or around
   patient body connected to a hub for physiological signal monitoring. In
   in-body sensor-based WBAN, guaranteeing quality-of-service and
   prolonging network lifetime are major impediments due to the sensor
   location and limited battery capacity. In this article, we propose a
   novel energy-efficient medium access control (MAC) protocol for IEEE
   802.15.6 standard complaint in-body sensor-based WBAN. Typically, the
   in-body sensor-based WBAN communication is hub-initiated; however, in
   case of an emergency event, the in-body sensor node transmits an
   emergency frame arbitrarily without sensing the channel. This
   inadvertent in-body sensor-initiated transmission has a very high
   probability of collision with the ongoing hub-initiated transmission,
   and/or another in-body sensor-initiated emergency frame transmission.
   This results in emergency frame retransmission and consequently affects
   the node's energy consumption and lifetime. To alleviate this issue, we
   propose a modified superframe structure, in which separate access phases
   are introduced for the emergency event and regular event. In case of an
   emergency event, a novel emergency event handling scheme and a ranking
   and priority assignment protocol is proposed to detect and address the
   critical event of in-body sensors. To minimize the collision, a
   scheduled access mechanism is proposed according to the criticality of
   the node. Performance analysis of the proposed in-body sensor MAC is
   done in terms of latency and overall power consumption, in case of both
   emergency and regular events.},

Abstract = {Wireless body area network (WBAN) solution is an emerging technology to
   resolve the small area connection issues around human body, especially

   control (MAC) protocol for WBAN with focus on the simplicity,
   dependability and power efficiency. Considering the support to multiple
   physical layer (PHY) technologies including ultra-wide band (UWB), the
   slotted ALOHA is employed in the contention access period (CAP) to
   request the slot allocation. Mini-slot method is designed to enhance the
   efficiency of the contention. Moreover, sufficient slot allocation in
   the contention-free period (CFP) makes the proposed protocol adaptive to
   the different traffic including the medical and non-medical
   applications. Simulation results show that the protocol effectively
   decreases the probability of collision in a CAP and extends the CFP
   slots to support more traffic with quality of service (QoS) guarantee.},

Abstract = {This paper presents improved Adaptive Medium Access Control (iA-MAC)
   protocol for Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs). In addition to the
   adaptive guard band assignment technique, the newly proposed protocol
   has an improved as well as adaptive sleep/wakeup mechanism. We consider
   a simple temperature measuring application, where sensors (nodes) sense
   human body for updated information. If the current readings are within
   normal range, nodes stay in idle state (do not access channel). On the
   other hand, if the current sensed information is within high range then
   nodes switch to active state and access the channel because critical
   information needs to be transmitted as soon as possible. Besides the
   normal and high ranges of temperature, if the current sensed temperature
   lies with pre-high range then nodes access for channel if and only if
   the current sensed data is not duplicated version of the previously
   sensed data. Moreover, iA-MAC uses well defined synchronization
   mechanism to avoid collisions between data as well as control packets.
   Simulation results show that performance of the newly proposed iA-MAC
   protocol is better than its existing counter part protocols in terms of
   the selected performance metrics.},

Abstract = {Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is the cheapest solution using
   BioMedical Sensors. They monitor different physiological vital signs of
   a patient. The output of vital signs does not accept collision, delay,
   loss, and a high energy consumption of BMSs. This paper proposes Energy
   Efficient and Delay-Aware Adaptive Slots Allocation Medium Access
   Control (EED-MAC) Protocol for WBAN. This Proposed MAC provides
   sufficient and dedicated channels to all types of BMSs. The patient's
   data are divided according to the need of a patient. Moreover, the
   contentions of BMSs are reduced and does not drop data by proposing a
   Reduced Contention Adaptive Slots Allocation CSMA/CA (RCA-CSMA/CA)
   scheme. The third proposed scheme is Reliability-Aware Channel
   Allocation (RAC), which allocates channels for emergency-based BMSs
   using alert signals without contention. The simulation of the proposed
   MAC and other schemes achieve significant improvements against the
   state-of-the-art MAC protocols.},

Abstract = {Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) have been developed rapidly with the
   increasing popularity of wireless network and wearable technologies. The
   inherent characteristics of convenience and efficiency for health
   monitoring facilitate the depth and width of WBAN applications. However,
   the inter-WBAN interference problem affects the network performance in
   intensive WBAN scenarios, degrading reliability and increasing latency
   of health data. In this paper, we propose a Two-Tier Multi-channel
   Medium Access Control (2TM-MAC) protocol with interference mitigation
   for reliable health monitoring. Specially, the 2TM-MAC establishes an
   inter-WBAN interference matrix for every WBAN to show the mutual
   interference among coexisting WBANs. We design a multi-channel selection
   algorithm at the first tier to select different numbers of channels for
   each WBAN to avoid inter-WBAN interference and collisions. At the second
   tier, the hub of each WBAN schedules the available channels assigned
   from the first tier to sensor nodes according to their traffic
   requirements, mitigating the intra-WBAN interference as well. 2TM-MAC
   protocol enhances the reliability of emergency data and service
   experience in healthcare applications. Simulation results show the
   2TM-MAC protocol significantly improves the network throughput and
   decreases the average packet delay compared with IEEE 802.15.6 for
   densely deployed coexisting WBANs scenarios.},

Abstract = {Compared with typical wireless sensor networks, wireless body area
   networks (WBANs) have distinct features: on-body communication, a large
   amount of interference, and dynamic topology changes caused by gestures.
   Accordingly, the resource management algorithm in the medium access
   control (MAC) protocol should be dynamic, adaptive, and
   energy-efficient. Hence, recent studies tend to optimize the available
   resources by applying several types of analytical models. Although these
   models have been categorized in terms of their objectives, the major
   differences between their methodologies have not been emphasized and
   discussed. In this study, we classify the analytical models applicable
   to dynamic resource management, and clarify their characteristics and
   use cases. We present the basic principles, approach classification,
   comparison, and guidance for dynamic resource management, and
   investigate state-of-the-art resource management techniques according to
   the corresponding analytical models. Furthermore, research challenges on
   dynamic resource management in WBAN are identified to facilitate future
   research in this area.},

Abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN)
   combined together with modern health care systems are the future of
   healthcare practices. WBAN witness an upward interest in healthcare
   sector and is more advanced than any existing telemedicine system. WBAN
   is an upgraded version of WSN in which number of sensors used are very
   less in number as compared to WSN and used for monitoring health care.
   Energy utilization and network lifetime are the main two major
   challenges in WBAN as recharging and replace batteries of sensors
   attached to a human body may lead to one's uneasiness. In recent years,
   research has been focused on channel modelling, energy consumption,
   design of efficient medium access control (MAC) protocols for body area
   networks.For handling emergency data of networks, in this paper, we
   deployed in numerous practical WBAN scenarios using MAC protocol and
   tested in more generic Time Division Multiple access (TDMA) approach for
   avoid packet collision which leads to higher packet loss rate. It is
   tested in more generic topologies, contrasting the model's efficiency to
   the highly esteemed and most remarkable methodologies in the literature.
   Simulation results show improved performance of the proposed protocols
   in comparison to the selected existing ones in terms of the chosen

Abstract = {Wireless body area networks have been deployed to monitor the health
   condition of patients. In these applications, multiple sensors are
   required to report real-time data to the sink such that a physician can
   diagnose accurately, particularly for intensive care patients, which
   boosts the convergecast traffic load and increases the collision
   probability. However, the existing protocols cannot effectively operate
   under such concurrent traffic load. To bridge this gap, we present a
   novel two-phase receiver-initiated medium access control (MAC) protocol
   for concurrent traffic based on asynchronous duty cycling, which is
   called C-MAC. Technically, C-MAC in the first phase employs
   carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance of the IEEE
   802.15.6 standard and designs an ordering-based communication algorithm
   to effectively avoid collisions. Moreover, C-MAC enables sensor nodes to
   switch to standby mode to avoid idle listening and overhearing in the
   second phase. Furthermore, theoretically, we explicitly formulate the
   mathematical expressions of the random delay and energy consumption of
   C-MAC. Finally, we conduct extensive numerical analysis and simulation
   to demonstrate the correctness of theoretical results and the better
   effectiveness and efficiency of C-MAC than that of RI-MAC and A-MAC in
   terms of transmission delay and energy consumption.},

Abstract = {In recent years interest in the application of Wireless Body Area
   Network (WBAN) for patient monitoring applications has grown
   significantly. A WBAN can be used to develop patient monitoring systems
   which offer flexibility to medical staff and mobility to patients.
   Patients monitoring could involve a range of activities including data
   collection from various body sensors for storage and diagnosis,
   transmitting data to remote medical databases, and controlling medical
   appliances, etc. Also, WBANs could operate in an interconnected mode to
   enable remote patient monitoring using telehealth/e-health applications.
   A WBAN can also be used to monitor athletes' performance and assist them
   in training activities. For such applications it is very important that
   a WBAN collects and transmits data reliably, and in a timely manner to a
   monitoring entity. In order to address these issues, this paper presents
   WBAN design techniques for medical applications. We examine the WBAN
   design issues with particular emphasis on the design of MAC protocols
   and power consumption profiles of WBAN. Some simulation results are
   presented to further illustrate the performances of various WBAN design
   techniques.},

Abstract = {Collision problem is critical for the performance of coexisting Wireless
   Body Area Networks (WBANs). This paper presents a collision analysis of
   CSMA/CA based MAC protocol in the view of collision probability under
   duty cycled superframe structure. Firstly, we discuss two types of chief
   collisions at a micro level (i.e., staggered collisions and direct
   collisions) in the presence of hidden and exposed terminals,
   respectively. Then we discuss various direct collisions between RTS/CTS
   frames in slotted CSMA/CA. Furthermore, we highlight a special type of
   direct collisions which can neither be detected by interfering nodes nor
   discovered before the collisions of DATAs (i.e., indiscoverable
   collisions). A hypothesis, several propositions and conclusions are
   presented to explain which is the domination of the collisions and how
   the direct collisions are released. Numerical results verify our
   conclusions and confirm that the indiscoverable collisions turn out to
   be another key issue in coexisting WBANs. The simulation in mobile
   environment with time-varying traffic is carried out to show the impact
   of collisions on network performance. To the best of our knowledge, this
   paper is the most comprehensive collision analysis at the micro level
   for the evolution of CSMA/CA based MAC protocol and the first estimation
   of indiscoverable collisions in duty cycled WBANs.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In recent years, eHealth systems based on the Internet of Things (IoT)
   have attracted considerable attention. The wireless body area network
   (WBAN) is an essential technology of eHealth systems. A major challenge
   in WBAN is the design of the medium access control (MAC) protocol, which
   plays a significant role in avoiding collisions, enhancing the energy
   efficiency, maximizing the network life, and improving the quality of
   service (QoS) as well as the quality of experience (QoE). In this study,
   we apply the mobile edge computing (MEC) network architecture to an
   eHealth system and design a multi-channel MAC protocol for WBAN based on
   the Markov decision process (MDP). In this protocol, the channel
   condition and the reward value are considered. By continuously
   interacting with the environment, the optimal channel resource
   allocation strategy is generated. Simulation results indicate that the
   proposed WBAN MAC protocol can adaptively assign different channels to
   the sensor nodes for data transmission, thereby reducing the collision
   rate, decreasing the energy consumption, improving the channel
   utilization, and enhancing the system throughput and QoE.},

   Control Protocol in Wireless Body Area Network},
Journal = {COMPUTERS},

Abstract = {Biomedical sensors (BMSs) monitor the heterogeneous vital signs of
   patients. They have diverse Quality of Service (QoS) requirements
   including reduced collision, delay, loss, and energy consumption in the
   transmission of data, which are non-constrained, delay-constrained,
   reliability-constrained, and critical. In this context, this paper
   proposes a traffic priority-aware adaptive slot allocation-based medium
   access control (TraySL-MAC) protocol. Firstly, a reduced contention
   adaptive slot allocation algorithm is presented to minimize contention
   rounds. Secondly, a low threshold vital signs criticality-based adaptive
   slot allocation algorithm is developed for high priority data. Thirdly,
   a high threshold vital signs criticality-based adaptive slot allocation
   algorithm is designed for low priority data. Simulations are performed
   to comparatively evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol with
   state-of-the-art MAC protocols. From the analysis of the results, it is
   evident that the proposed protocol is beneficial in terms of lower
   packet delivery delay and energy consumption, and higher throughput in
   realistic biomedical environments.},

Abstract = {Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) have received considerable attention
   in recent years. Several sensors are placed in and around the human body
   to gather health information. One of the main challenges in WBANs is the
   design of a Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol that plays a vital role
   for the efficient functionality. In this paper we propose a graph-based
   priority-aware MAC protocol for WBANs. The network cluster-tree topology
   is modeled as an interference graph. Using graph coloring scheme, the
   contention-free time slots are assigned to the sensor nodes. Data
   priority is considered in the procedure of time slot reallocation.
   Simulation results show that the scheme improves the network

Abstract = {This paper presents a novel energy-efficient and reliable connection to
   enhance the transmission of data over a shared medium for wireless body
   area networks (WBAN). We propose a novel protocol of two master
   nodes-based cooperative protocol. In the proposed protocol, two master
   nodes were considered, that is, the belt master node and the outer body
   master node. The master nodes work cooperatively to avoid the
   retransmission process by sensors due to fading and collision, reducing
   the bit error rate (BER), which results in a reduction of the duty cycle
   and average transmission power. In addition, we have also presented a
   mathematical model of the duty cycle with the proposed protocol for the
   WBAN. The results show that the proposed cooperative protocol reduced
   the BER by a factor of 4. The average transmission power is reduced by a
   factor of 0.21 and this shows the potential of the proposed technique to
   be used in future wearable wireless sensors and systems.},

Abstract = {Wireless body area network (WBAN) is a remarkable, reliable and the most
   beneficial trend in the e-health monitoring system. WBANs are operated
   using low power wireless technology to link minute sensors with invasive
   or non-invasive technology for examining the patients. WBANs when used
   in a dense environment or operated along with other wireless sensor
   networks, there occurs communication interference which may reduce the
   system performance due to unstable signal integrity. So interference
   mitigation should be considered in the design. The interference is
   basically of two types: inter-network and intra-network interference.
   This paper focuses on a comparative study of mitigation techniques of
   inter-network interference and also discusses the open issues in WBAN.},

Title = {Adaptive Medium Access Control Protocol for Wireless Body Area Networks},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS},
Year = {2014},
Abstract = {Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) are widely used for applications
   such as modern health-care systems, where wireless sensors (nodes)
   monitor the parameter(s) of interest. Nodes are provided with limited
   battery power and battery power is dependent on radio activity. MAC
   protocols play a key role in controlling the radio activity. Therefore,
   we present Adaptive Medium Access Control (A-MAC) protocol for WBANs
   supported by linear programming models for the minimization of energy
   consumption and maximization of dataflow. Our proposed protocol is
   adaptive in terms of guard band assignment technique and sleep/wakeup
   mechanism. We focus on specific application to monitor human body with
   the help of nodes which continuously scan body for updated information.
   If the current value is within normal range, nodes do not try to access
   channel. However, if the current value rises or falls beyond the
   permissible range, nodes switch on their transceiver to access channel.
   Moreover, A-MAC uses TDMA approach to access channel and well-defined
   synchronization scheme to avoid collisions. Furthermore, we conduct a
   comprehensive analysis supported by MATLAB simulations to provide
   estimation of delay spread. Simulation results justify that the proposed
   protocol performs better in terms of network lifetime and throughput as
   compared to the counterpart protocols.},

Abstract = {Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) are introduced as an enabling
   technology in tele-health for patient monitoring. Designing an efficient
   Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol is the main challenge in WBANs
   because of their various applications and strict requirements such as
   low level of energy consumption, low transmission delay, the wide range
   of data rates and prioritizing emergency data. In this paper, we propose
   a new MAC protocol to provide different requirements of WBANs targeted
   for medical applications. The proposed MAC provides an efficient
   emergency response mechanism by considering the correlation between
   medical signals. It also reduces the power consumption of nodes by
   minimizing contention access, reducing the probability of the collision
   and using an efficient synchronization algorithm. In addition, the
   proposed MAC protocol increases the data rate of the nodes by allocating
   the resources according to the condition of the network. Analytical and
   simulation results show that the proposed MAC protocol outperforms IEEE
   802.15.4 MAC protocol in terms of power consumption level as well as the
   average response delay. Also, the comparison results of the proposed MAC
   with IEEE 802.15.6 MAC protocol show a tradeoff between average response
   delay and medical data rate.},

Abstract = {Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled wireless body area networks (WBANs) are
   resource-constrained in nature (energy, bandwidth, and time-slot
   resources); hence, their performance in healthcare monitoring often
   deteriorates as the number of active IoT devices sharing the network
   increases. Consequently, improving the network efficiency of IoT-enabled
   WBAN systems is essential for improving healthcare monitoring. Hence, we
   propose an energy-efficient multichannel hybrid medium access control
   (MAC) (MC-HYMAC) protocol that combines the benefits of the carrier
   sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) and time
   division multiple access (TDMA) protocols to improve the overall
   performance of IoT-enabled WBAN systems. We also proposed an adaptive
   power control scheme, time-slot management scheme, channel utilization
   mechanism, and dynamic back-off time policy to improve the overall
   network efficiency. In addition, we applied a finite-state discrete-time
   Markov model to determine the traffic arrival pattern and analyze the
   transition states of biomedical devices to facilitate optimal
   decision-making for enhanced overall performance of the network.
   Standard metrics, such as energy efficiency, throughput, delay, packet
   drop ratio, and network lifetime, were used to evaluate and compare the
   existing MAC protocols.},

Abstract = {The introduction of the Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) grows
   significantly regarding its flexibility, accuracy, costs efficiency and
   mobility. It supports a huge range of innovative applications that
   improve the quality of life and enhance services. In the health care
   system, the majority of WBAN applications are responsible of handling
   critical data in order to monitor the patient health state and to save
   his live in many cases. That's why WBAN should efficiently deliver
   patient's vital signs to specialized medical entity (doctor,
   emergency,..). However, the particular architecture of WBAN and the
   movement patterns of the body part affect the communication quality.
   Moreover, the number of WBAN nodes increases the contention level to
   access to the shared wireless medium; this consequently produces packets
   collisions and the loss of critical data. We evaluated in this article
   the performance of the WBAN within different scenarios. We investigated
   different effects of the number of nodes as well as the different body
   state (standing, running) on the WBAN's reliability. We, finally,
   proposed a simple, no cost and convenient Adaptive Transmit Power
   Mechanism (ATPM) to improve the WBAN link quality without consuming
   unnecessary energy.},

Abstract = {As a kind of short distance wireless communication network, wireless
   body area network (WBAN) can be widely used in wireless medical, motion
   detection, personal entertainment and other scenes. However, the
   existence of interference seriously affects the performance of WBAN,
   which results in packet loss and the increase of energy consumption and
   delay. It is worth noting that multi-channel MAC protocols can mitigate
   interference by avoiding multiple nodes using the same or similar
   spectrum resources. In this paper, we propose an interference mitigation
   MAC protocol (ININIAC) to improve the performance of throughput and
   delay. Specifically, we first present a channel mapping mechanism to
   clarify the state of each channel and mitigate the effects of
   interference. Considering the unfairness between high and low
   priorities, we thus describe a channel selection strategy to improve the
   transmission efficiency of different priority traffics. Moreover, we put
   forward a novel collision avoidance mechanism to reduce the probability
   of packets collision. Simulation results show that INIMAC can reduce the
   delay and improve the throughput and channel utilization significantly.},

   Body Area Networks},
Journal = {SENSORS},

Abstract = {Recently, wireless body area networks (WBANs) have attracted significant
   consideration in ubiquitous healthcare. A number of medium access
   control (MAC) protocols, primarily derived from the superframe structure
   of the IEEE 802.15.4, have been proposed in literature. These MAC
   protocols aim to provide quality of service (QoS) by prioritizing
   different traffic types in WBANs. A contention access period (CAP) with
   high contention in priority-based MAC protocols can result in higher
   number of collisions and retransmissions. During CAP, traffic classes
   with higher priority are dominant over low-priority traffic; this has
   led to starvation of low-priority traffic, thus adversely affecting WBAN
   throughput, delay, and energy consumption. Hence, this paper proposes a
   traffic-adaptive priority-based superframe structure that is able to
   reduce contention in the CAP period, and provides a fair chance for
   low-priority traffic. Simulation results in ns-3 demonstrate that the
   proposed MAC protocol, called traffic-adaptive priority-based MAC
   (TAP-MAC), achieves low energy consumption, high throughput, and low
   latency compared to the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, and the most recent
   priority-based MAC protocol, called priority-based MAC protocol
   (PA-MAC).},

Abstract = {The current literature on discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) based
   analysis of IEEE 802.15.6 MAC protocols for wireless body area networks
   (WBANs), do not consider the ACK timeout state, wherein the colliding
   nodes check the ill fate of their transmissions, while other contending
   nodes perform backoff check that slot as usual. In this paper, our DTMC
   model accurately captures the carrier sense multiple access with
   collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) mechanism of IEEE 802.15.6 medium access
   control (MAC) and allows the contending nodes performing backoff to
   utilize the ACK timeout slot during collisions. The compared rigorous
   results are obtained by considering a non-ideal channel in
   non-saturation conditions, and CSMA/CA parameters pertaining to UWB PHY
   of IEEE 802.15.6 MAC protocols.},

Abstract = {WBAN offers promising and innovative applications that enhance the
   quality of services provided by the healthcare system; it improves
   patient's quality of life and saves his lives in many situations. WBAN
   is composed of tiny medical devices on or implanted in the human body
   and continuously monitors patient's health. The wireless interface and
   the mobility of the body network enable easier, practical and less cost
   applications. WBAN provides uninterrupted distantly health monitoring of
   patient while he is doing his daily activity and it expect to
   efficiently deliver emergency collected vital signs to the concerned
   medical entity. However, the high contention level inside the WBAN, the
   presence of external collocated wireless network and the use of a shared

   analyse the interference's problem of the WBAN based IEEE 802.15.4

   adequate simulator and configurable mobility model to investigate
   different effects of the WBAN density as well as the increase number of

Abstract = {Intelligent wireless body area networks (WBANs) have entered into an
   incredible explosive popularization stage. WBAN technologies facilitate
   real-time and reliable health monitoring in e-healthcare and creative
   applications in other fields. However, due to the limited space and
   medical resources, deeply deployed WBANs are suffering severe
   interference problems. The interference affects the reliability and
   timeliness of data transmissions, and the impacts of interference become
   more serious in mobile WBANs because of the uncertainty of human
   movement. In this paper, we analyze the dynamic interference taking
   human mobility into consideration. The dynamic interference is
   investigated in different situations for WBANs coexistence. To guarantee
   the performance of different traffic types, a health critical index is
   proposed to ensure the transmission privilege of emergency data for
   intra-and inter-WBANs. Furthermore, the performance of the target WBAN,
   i.e., normalized throughput and average access delay, under different
   interference intensity are evaluated using a developed three-dimensional
   Markov chain model. Extensive numerical results show that the
   interference generated by mobile neighbor WBANs results in 70\%
   throughput decrease for general medical data and doubles the packet
   delay experienced by the target WBAN for emergency data compared with
   single WBAN. The evaluation results greatly benefit the network design
   and management as well as the interference mitigation protocols design.},

Abstract = {A wireless body area network consists of a network of implanted and
   wearable sensor nodes to transmit the biological information for
   wireless healthcare monitoring, elderly care, and many other innovative
   applications. To support mobility in these resource-constrained
   networks, suitable modifications have to be performed both at the medium
   access control and routing layers. Low-duty-cycle MAC protocols that
   avoid energy problems in the MAC Layer have been taken, and the
   performance with the RPL routing protocol has been evaluated. RPL is
   routing protocol proposed by IETF ROLL working group for low-power and
   lossy networks. In this paper, the performance of XMAC and ContikiMAC is
   analyzed with respect to RPL parameters and the results show that
   ContikiMAC consumes 49 \% less power compared to XMAC.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the issue of interference mitigation in wireless
   body area networks (BANs). Although several approaches have been
   proposed in BAN standard IEEE 802.15.6, they increase transmission
   latency or energy cost, and do not mitigate interference effectively. In
   order to avoid both intra-and inter-BAN interference, we present a MAC
   protocol with two-layer interference mitigation (2L-MAC) for BANs.
   Considering the QoS requirements of BANs, the proposed protocol not only
   avoids packet collisions but also reduces transmission delay and energy
   consumption in sensors. Moreover, channel switching is triggered
   whenever a BAN needs to acquire more bandwidth. Simulation results show
   that our protocol outperforms other protocols in terms of delivery rate,
   latency and energy saving.},

Title = {Traffic Class Prioritization-Based Slotted-CSMA/CA for IEEE 802.15.4 MAC

Abstract = {This paper proposes an improved Traffic Class Prioritization based
   Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance (TCP-CSMA/CA) scheme
   for prioritized channel access to heterogenous-natured Bio-Medical
   Sensor Nodes (BMSNs) for IEEE 802.15.4 Medium Access Control (MAC) in
   intra-Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs). The main advantage of the
   scheme is to provide prioritized channel access to heterogeneous-natured
   BMSNs of different traffic classes with reduced packet delivery delay,
   packet loss, and energy consumption, and improved throughput and packet
   delivery ratio (PDR). The prioritized channel access is achieved by
   assigning a distinct, minimized and prioritized backoff period range to
   each traffic class in every backoff during contention. In TCP-CSMA/CA,
   the BMSNs are distributed among four traffic classes based on the
   existing patient's data classification. The Backoff Exponent (BE) starts
   from 1 to remove the repetition of the backoff period range in the
   third, fourth, and fifth backoffs. Five moderately designed backoff
   period ranges are proposed to assign a distinct, minimized, and
   prioritized backoff period range to each traffic class in every backoff
   during contention. A comprehensive verification using NS-2 was carried
   out to determine the performance of the TCP-CSMA/CA in terms of packet
   delivery delay, throughput, PDR, packet loss ratio (PLR) and energy
   consumption. The results prove that the proposed TCP-CSMA/CA scheme
   performs better than the IEEE 802.15.4 based PLA-MAC, eMC-MAC, and
   PG-MAC as it achieves a 47\% decrease in the packet delivery delay and a
   63\% increase in the PDR.},

Title = {A simple cross-layer mechanism for congestion control and performance
   enhancement in a localized multiple wireless body area networks},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 JAN 27},
Abstract = {Commercialization of the wireless body area network (WBAN) envisions
   future new normal for WBAN devices coexistence in a localized area. The
   coexistence may allow devices to freely change positions, associate, or
   dissociate with the neighbours as users interact. Devices' interaction
   in a stationary or mobile fashion radiates heat and also competes for
   the limited network resources resulting to unreliable communication and
   other performance challenges. Besides alarming user safety, device
   mobility affects network performance through topology changes, which
   result to recursive link disconnections, energy waste, packet delay,
   degraded throughput, and congestion due to excessive control messaging
   during route repair. In this article, we propose WBAN performance
   optimization criteria focusing on improving energy efficiency, network
   throughput, and reducing the end to end delay in multiple existence
   schemes. Firstly, we propose an alternative routing algorithm, whose
   routing decision depends on a cost function considering the
   parameterized residue energy to node distance ratio, link energy
   reliability, and specific heat absorption in addition to node sequence
   number and hop count as fundamental route selection metrics. Secondly,
   we implement congestion control adaptation in the medium access control
   (IEEE 802.11MAC) mechanism, which improves throughput, reduces
   congestion, and delay. Due to link discontinuities during mobility, we
   demonstrate a comparative network performance to address the effect of
   WBAN speed at different hello intervals. The comparative analysis show,
   protocol implementation with a cross-layer approach outperforms the
   conventional protocol without MAC adaptations in terms of energy
   efficiency, network throughput, and a reduced end to end delay, by an
   average of 0.45\%, 2.8\%, and 13.7\%, respectively.},

   Here, given the limited battery lifetime and computational resources of

   management can be done in the medium-access control (MAC) layer, e.g.,
   via random access to the optical wireless channel. We propose the use of
   Slotted-ALOHA protocol, which has the potential advantages of simplicity
   and efficiency to reduce packet collisions and to enhance the overall
   throughput. We further optimize the network energy efficiency by taking
   into consideration a realistic channel model based on particle swarm
   optimization, given the high complexity of the optimization problem.
   This approach provides valuable insights into the efficient design of

Abstract = {Application areas of wireless body area networks (WBANs) are growing in
   our everyday lives and the main area being the medical field. WBANs are
   made up of small sensor nodes that monitor activities on the human body
   and send data to appropriate places. These sensors require energy and
   they are normally powered by small batteries. It is of utmost importance
   to make sure that the battery life of these sensors is conserved as much
   as possible as well as reliability of the network should be as high as
   possible. In this paper, media access control (MAC) protocols used for
   communication by the sensor nodes are analyzed using Castalia simulator
   based on the OMNET++ framework. A network consisting of 5 nodes is set
   up and mobility is configured on the suitable nodes, packets are then
   transmitted to the sink node. The IEEE 802.15.4, IEE802.15.6 and TMAC
   protocols are then used for media access and parameters such as battery
   usage, reliability, lifetime and latency of the network are observed as
   simulations are being carried out. It's observed that no protocol has
   all the desired properties such as high reliability and lower battery
   usage.},

Abstract = {The low power connectivity and short distance communication qualities of
   the IEEE 802.15.4 standard suits its application in wireless body
   (personal) area networks (WBAN). IEEE 802.15.4 protocol use carrier
   sense multiple access and collision avoidance (CSMA-CA) medium access
   control (MAC) mechanism for aperiodic data communication; however, it
   faces performance degradation with a gradual increase in the number of
   network devices. Performance challenges arise due to; several
   heterogeneous and dynamic packet sources sharing limited resources
   during contention in a finite backoff period, association delay, and
   traffic channel access through clear channel assessment (CCA)
   algorithms. Due to such constraints, channel conditions increase packet
   collision and queuing delay, which raises power demand and impedes
   performance indicators, such as throughput, packet delivery ratio (PDR),
   and end to end (E2E) delay. This article proposes an alternative
   combination of the backoff and CCA adaptation mechanisms to improve WBAN
   performance characteristics in a highly dynamic environment considering
   network residue energy, PDR, throughput, and E2E delay. We use the
   Markov model to demonstrate a theoretical analysis of the proposed
   CSMA-CA MAC mechanism. A comparative study shows the proposed methods
   outperform conventional protocol in PDR, throughput, and reduced E2E
   delay by 13.1\%, 21.44\%, and 41.13\%, respectively, where energy
   efficiency drops by 0.43\%.},

Abstract = {Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) open an interdisciplinary area within
   Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) research, with a tremendous impact in
   healthcare area where sensors are used to monitor, collect and transmit
   biological parameters of the human body. We propose the first
   network-MAC cross-layer broadcast protocol in WBAN. Our protocol,
   evaluated in the OMNET++ simulator enriched with a realistic human body
   mobility and channel model issued from a recent research on biomedical
   and health informatics, outperforms existing flat broadcast strategies
   in terms of network coverage, sensors energy consumption and correct
   reception of FIFO-ordered packets. We investigate the resilience of both
   existing flat broadcast strategies and our new cross-layer protocol face
   to various transmission rates and human body mobility. Existing flat
   broadcast strategies, without exception, start to have a drastic drop of
   performance for transmission rates above 11 Kb/s while our cross-layer
   protocol maintains its good performance for transmission rates up to 190
   Kb/s.},

   It considers the human dynamics and traffic information to meet the
   different QoS requirements of each sensor, improve bandwidth utilization
   and reduces packet collisions within networks. We apply a
   quality-of-service (QoS) resource allocation method to share limited
   bandwidth among multiple WBANs. In the proposed scheduling, the required
   service rate and maximum packet inter-arrival time for each WBAN are
   parameterized. The inter-arrival times of WBAN packets regarded as
   periodic tasks are then transformed to avoid scheduling jitters, thus
   increasing predictability and reducing packet collisions.},

Abstract = {Wireless body area network (WBAN) solution is an emerging new technology
   to resolve the small area connection issues around human body,
   especially for the medical applications. Based on the integrated
   superframe structure of IEEE 802.15.4, a modified medium access control
   (MAC) protocol, named Hybrid Unified-slot Access (HUA) protocol for
   WBANs is proposed with focus on the simplicity, dependability and power
   efficiency. Considering the support to multiple physical layer (PHY)
   technologies including ultra-wide band (UWB), the slotted ALOHA is
   employed in the contention access period (CAP) to request the slot
   allocation. Mini-slot method is designed to enhance the efficiency of
   the contention. Moreover, sufficient slot allocation in the
   contention-free period (CFP) makes HUA adaptive to the different traffic
   including the medical and non-medical applications. Simulation results
   show that the protocol effectively decreases the probability of
   collision in a CAP and extends the CFP slots to support more traffic
   with quality of service (QoS) guarantee.},

   Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) have grown considerably due to the
   increasing aging population. HMS expected to reduce healthcare expenses
   by enabling the continuous monitoring of patient health remotely during

   as a key technology in providing real-time health monitoring and
   diagnoses of many life threatening diseases. Accordingly, several
   studies have been done in this area and already various journal and
   conference papers focusing either on WBAN or on healthcare services.
   Nevertheless, there is no extensive coverage on the HMS based on WBAN.
   This tutorial will focus on the WBAN in terms of emerging wireless

Abstract = {Cross-layer design is considered a powerful alternative to solve the
   complexities of wireless communication in wireless body area networks
   (WBAN), where the classical communication model has been shown to be
   inaccurate. Regarding the energy consumption problem, we have prepared a
   current survey of the most relevant scientific publications on
   energy-efficient cross-layer design for WBAN. In this paper, we provide
   a comprehensive review of the advances in cross-layer approaches,
   protocols and optimizations aimed at increasing the network lifetime by
   saving energy in WBANs. Subsequently, we discuss the relevant aspects
   and shortcomings of these energy-efficient cross-layer techniques and
   point out the open research issues and challenges in WBAN cross-layer
   design. In this survey, we propose a taxonomy for cross-layer approaches
   to fit them into categories based on the protocols involved in the
   cross-layer scheme. A novel classification is included to clarify the
   theoretical concepts behind each cross-layer scheme; and to group
   similar approaches by establishing their differences from the other
   strategies reviewed. Our conclusion considers the aspects of mobility
   and channel modeling in WBAN scenarios as the directions of future
   cross-layer research for WBAN and telemedicine applications.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes an optimised Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol to
   minimise the number of channel access collisions and to improve the
   bandwidth efficiency of IoT-based Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs).
   The frame structure of the proposed MAC protocol consists of three
   different phases, namely Contention Phase (CP), Transmission Phase (TP),
   and Inactive Phase (IP). During CP, the proposed protocol prioritises
   the life-sensitive data. Based on allocated priority, the communicating
   sensor nodes (SNs) compete for channel access. During TP, the successful
   SNs transmit their data. We use TDMA mechanism for data transmission and
   Spider Monkey Optimisation (SMO) technique to improve the bandwidth
   efficiency of the system by selecting the best possible TDMA time slot

Title = {A Novel Multi-Phase Multi-Objective GOA-Based MAC Protocol for IoT-Based
   WBANs},
Journal = {IETE JOURNAL OF RESEARCH},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 FEB 26},
Abstract = {Future Internet-of-Things (IoT) based Wireless Body Area Networks
   (WBANs) are characterised by densely populated Body Sensor Nodes (BSNs)
   with limited battery capacity. One of the significant challenges in
   IoT-based WBANs is to develop a Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol
   that is efficient in terms of BSNs' energy consumption, ensures reliable
   communication, optimises channel bandwidth utilisation, and finds the
   best possible performance of the network. Therefore, this paper proposes
   a Multi-Phase Multi-Objective (MPMO) Grasshopper Optimisation Algorithm
   (GOA) oriented Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol, namely
   MPMO-GOA-MAC, which mainly consists of a frame structure having three
   different phases, namely the Time Slots Allocation Phase (TSAP),
   Transmission Phase (TP), and Inactive Phase (IP). During TSAP, data
   packet prioritisation takes place, which minimises the channel access
   collisions among the BSNs. During TP, a Time Division Multiple Access
   (TDMA) mechanism having variable-sized time-slots is used for data
   packet transmission to improve the channel utilisation. Lastly, during
   IP, BSNs go into sleep mode to save energy. Additionally, a GOA-based
   optimisation mechanism is used to optimise the lengths of TSAP, TP, and
   IP durations in the protocol. The simulation results show that the
   proposed protocol achieves 2.19\%, 8.89\%, and 12.86\% improvement in
   throughput and 6.96\%, 14.07\%, and 18.93\% less average data packet
   delay as compared to Multi-Class-MAC, NP-CSMA/TDMA-MAC, and BASEline-MAC
   schemes, respectively. Additionally, the proposed protocol achieves 8\%,
   29.1\%, and 540\% less energy consumption as compared to PrEE-MAC,
   Multi-Class-MAC, and BASEline-MAC protocols, respectively.},

Abstract = {Wireless body area networks (WBAN) has penetrated immensely in
   revolutionizing the classical heathcare system. Recently, number of WBAN
   applications has emerged which introduce potential limits to existing
   solutions. In particular, IEEE 802.15.6 standard has provided great
   flexibility, provisions and capabilities to deal emerging applications.
   In this paper, we investigate the application-specific throughput
   analysis by fine-tuning the physical (PHY) and medium access control
   (MAC) parameters of the IEEE 802.15.6 standard. Based on PHY
   characterizations in narrow band, at the MAC layer, carrier sense
   multiple access collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) and scheduled access
   protocols are extensively analyzed. It is concluded that, IEEE 802.15.6
   standard can satisfy most of the WBANs applications throughput
   requirements by maximum achieving 680 Kbps. However, those emerging
   applications which require high quality audio or video transmissions,
   standard is not able to meet their constraints. Moreover, delay, energy
   efficiency and successful packet reception are considered as key
   performance metrics for comparing the MAC protocols. CSMA/CA protocol
   provides the best results to meet the delay constraints of medical and
   non-medical WBAN applications. Whereas, the scheduled access approach,
   performs very well both in energy efficiency and packet reception ratio.},

Abstract = {Evolution of Wireless sensor networks (WSN) has found its identity in
   Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) to monitor the health status of
   adults undergone a surgery, etc. In addition, the mobility of the sensor
   nodes deployed on/in the human body plays a vital role in maintaining
   the accuracy of the physiological signal. In this paper, a Distributed
   Posture-based Traffic-Medium Access Control (DPT-MAC) protocol is
   proposed where the sensor nodes follow the Disc Communication model for
   the detection of neighbor nodes based on the proximity of the sensing
   range. Further, the modified IEEE 802.15.4 superframe structure
   determines the potential sleep posture of a subject to ensure a
   collision-free data transmission and prioritize the data traffic based
   on the criticality of the data like critical, periodic and nonregular
   data. The critical data detection occupies the channel on high priority
   and will have the probability to access the other channel space during
   the contention period of the noncritical data. The regular guaranteed
   time slot (GTS) is reduced from the tradition number of slots to five,
   which allows the nodes to handle the throughput. This uninterrupted data
   transmission minimizes the delay rate and collision ratio with any
   number of sensor nodes as the channel synchronization is strictly
   followed using the Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance
   mechanism. Here, the optimization of the network quality parameters like
   energy consumption, throughput, delay and collision ratio assures a
   guaranteed increase in the Network Lifetime. The results show that the
   distributed topology outperforms the conventional star topology in
   sustaining the Network Lifetime.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of interference when multiple time
   division multiple access-based wireless body area networks (WBANs) come
   in the proximity of one another. We propose a simple solution that
   creates common non-conflicting schedule between these interfering WBANs.
   Our proposed scheme allows the reuse of maximum possible time slots
   among WBANs that are two-hop neighbors of one another. A flow admission
   control scheme is applied to control the flows during the period of
   interference. We show that the percentage of flows admitted because of
   flow control decreases with the increase in the network size and flow
   rate. We simulated a scenario where WBANs move randomly within a
   simulation area with a certain speed and meet at a particular point. We
   show that the signal to interference noise ratio (SINR) value of WBANs
   changes as long as they are within the transmission range of one
   another. Also, we show that the exchanges of common schedule (which is
   dependent on the number of times the SINR value drops below the
   threshold) are required in order to improve the packet delivery ratio in
   WBANs. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {Interference is a serious problem in Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs)
   and heavily weakens system performance. In this paper, we propose an
   exchange-free resource scheduling scheme to overcome the interference of
   dynamic coexisting WBANs. For each data transmission period, we design a
   transmission channel/slot allocation scheme based on a Latin square,
   where each character denotes a specific combination of a channel and a
   time slot. For each data retransmission period, we design a
   retransmission time-slot selection scheme based on a hash function, in
   which the unique identity information of the collided node is used to
   calculate the retransmission slot. Compared with existing solutions, our
   work has two key advantages. First, all nodes can independently allocate
   and coordinate resources rather than exchange information with each
   other in traditional methods, and thus guaranteeing strong adaptability
   to the fast changes of WBANs. Second, the contention-free resource
   allocation pattern is implemented for both the data transmission period
   as well as the data retransmission period, and thus guaranteeing no

Abstract = {Wearable computing technologies are becoming widely used in healthcare
   and for tracking various human work and leisure activities. The
   collection and transmission of sensor data are fundamental functions of
   these technologies. A wireless body area network (WBAN) helps these
   wearable devices to continuously acquire ambulatory and physiological
   signals in real time with multiple sensor nodes attached or implanted
   into a human body. Sensor nodes transmit data to a sink node with
   wireless connections can enable mobility of human bodies. Since the data
   transmission rate of each sensor node is different, we proposed a
   variable-rate transmission MAC protocol (VTMAC) with coordinator
   election based on the time division multiple access method. This
   adaptive coordinator election scheme can balance the sensor nodes' power
   consumption to extend the lifetime of WBAN as possible. It can also
   flexibly allocate time slots for each sensor node according to their
   different data transmission rates to enhance the efficiency of networks.
   The proposed method has been implemented and demonstrated on a hardware
   wireless communication platform with multiple wearable sensor nodes.
   Simulations show the VTMAC can achieve less power consumption and higher
   throughput performance compared with conventional protocols especially
   in high data transmission rate situation for the body area networks we
   simulated.},

   Body Area Networks Using Integrated Sensors},
Journal = {IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL},

Abstract = {Integrated sensor systems are the promising solutions to the multiprobe
   design of biomedical sensors for energy efficient wireless body area
   networks (WBANs). To improve energy efficiency and communication
   quality-of-service (QoS) of integrated sensor hubs, a cross-layered
   energy-aware resource allocation (CLEAR) is proposed to exploit the
   characteristics of medium access control (MAC) and physical (PHY) layers
   of WBANs. The proposed MAC protocol applies a twin-token bucket model
   and real-time scheduling to the active superframe interleaving and
   beacon shifting techniques defined in the IEEE 802.15.6 standard. In
   addition, the proposed period transformation controlling task end-to-end
   delay improves the QoS while reducing packet collisions. The proposed
   PHY protocol is a hybrid of the transmit power control (TPC) and link
   adaption (LA) strategies, which coordinates the receiver and transmitter
   with link parameters including data rate, bit error ratio, receiver
   sensitivity, transmission power, modulation, etc. It adapts the link
   quality due to human postures or movements to meet the required QoS
   while minimizing the energy consumption of the transceiver front-end.
   Experimental results show that CLEAR outperforms existing methods in
   terms of packet delivery ratio, delay, bandwidth utilization, and energy
   consumption. In particular, CLEAR reduces average end-to-end delay by
   21\% as compared to existing methods, and saves an average of 18\% of
   energy consumption over the TPC and LA-based methods at a power of -25
   dBm while achieving a maximum 0.05 packet error ratio.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a data sensitive adaptive Medium Access Control
   (DSA-MAC) protocol for intra-hospital scenario. Main feature of this
   protocol is to prioritize the node, based on sensitivity of data it has
   to communicate. Recent advancements in Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN)
   supported biomedical sensors, have given new direction to the health
   monitoring techniques. In wireless body area network, multiple
   biomedical sensors are planted on/in the patient's body which is
   wirelessly linked to the network. The standard protocol such as IEEE
   802.15.4 for body area network (BAN) cannot fulfil all the requirements
   as they do not assist or maintain prioritized and varied data transfer
   requirements of various medical sensor nodes. This paper proposes a
   DSA-MAC protocol by prioritizing the available medical sensor data for
   channel allocation. The performance analysis of DSA-MAC shows that it
   outperforms other conventional MAC protocols in terms of throughput,

   in health monitoring system as well as the study of the application of
   wearable and implanted Bio-Medical-Sensors (BMS) which are used to
   monitor the vital signs of a patient in early detection. Energy
   efficiency is a significant issue in WBAN which can be achieved by
   reducing the overhead of control packets, prioritizing sensor-nodes and
   sink-node selection. Moreover, uncertainty in network topologies, such
   as distance and link affect between sensor-nodes occurs due to the
   mobility of human. In this research, we propose a scheme to reduce the
   overhead of control packets and prioritizing the threshold values of
   vital signs by assigning low and high transmission power with enhanced
   IEEE802.15.6 CSMA/CA as well as introduce a Mobility Link Table (MLT)

Abstract = {One of key attributes of WBAN is to extend the network lifetime, which
   can be achieved by adjusting the wakeup and sleep modes of the sensor
   nodes. Traditional low-power methods such as channel polling and
   periodic duty cycling are unable to satisfy WBANs requirements due to
   idle listening, collision, and control packet overhead problems. In this
   paper, we propose an RFID-enabled MAC protocol (RMAC) for WBAN that
   dynamically adjusts the wakeup and sleep modes of the nodes according to
   the traffic, thus solving the idle listening and overhearing problems.
   The protocol accommodates normal and emergency traffic using
   pre-scheduled and RFID wakeup methods. Analytical expressions are
   derived to analyze the power consumption and delay of the proposed
   protocol for normal and emergency traffic. The analytical expressions
   are further validated by extensive simulations using Network Simulator
   2(NS2).},

Abstract = {In recent era, the area of monitoring the health of the patients is
   gaining an interesting research due to its notable properties in the
   smart health environment. For such application the biomedical sensors
   are equipped to gather the condition of the patient. Traditional methods
   in the same concern do not offer appropriate medical services to the
   user. During each emergency data transmission, there is less delay,
   increased energy consumption and reduced throughput. Further, the
   critical packets are not routed with higher priority. In some emergency
   conditions the data must be routed to the medical server (MS) with
   priority and thus avoid delay of medical services offered to the
   user/patient. Here, we propose QoS Effective Protocol (QoSEP)
   provisioned Wireless Body Area Network system for the effective routing
   of the critical packets to the destination MS. To improve the quality in
   service offered, we use Ant Colony Optimization for Critical Packet
   Routing for finding the shortest route with less energy consumption, low
   delay and high throughput. Here, the assumption of priority to the
   critical packets and scheduling is performed to improve the speed in
   emergency packet transmission. Finally, we evaluate the efficiency of
   the proposed method by comparison with other existing approaches. The
   achievements of the proposed QoSEP is compared in terms of energy
   consumption, throughput, PDR and delay. The performance of the proposed
   method is compared with the other existing methods and the performance
   of QoSEP is better than the other approaches. The simulation results
   achieve 97.5, 90 and 91\% of throughput, 0.2, 0.05 and 0.3 J of energy,
   0.1, 1, and 1.1 ms delay and 95, 91, 90\% of Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR)

Abstract = {Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) has been a potential avenue for future
   digitized healthcare systems. WBAN has unique challenges and features
   compared to other wireless sensor networks. In addition to battery power
   consumption, the vulnerability and the unpredicted channel behaviour
   make channel access a serious problem. Time Division Multiple Access
   (TDMA) Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols can help in achieving a
   reliable and energy efficient WBAN. IEEE 802.15.4 provides TDMA based
   mechanisms to save energy consumption. However, both contention-free and
   inactive periods are static and do not consider channel status or nodes
   reliability requirements. Hence, this paper presents two IEEE 802.15.4
   TDMA based techniques to improve WBAN reliability and energy efficiency.
   The first technique allows nodes to avoid channel deep fade by
   distributing adaptively their sleep period during their active period
   according to their channel status. Thereafter, in the second technique,
   nodes are dynamically allocated time slots according to their
   requirements, which depend on their link's status. The proposed
   techniques are evaluated within various traffic rates and their
   performances are compared with the legacy IEEE 802.15.4 MAC. Results
   reveal that the proposed techniques are able to promote the WBAN
   reliability and energy efficiency.},

Abstract = {Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) is a promising low power technology
   that enables the communications between body area sensor nodes and a
   central coordinator. It targets at many applications in e-Health
   services. In WBAN, different data sources generate time-varying traffic.
   Large traffic volume may result in intolerant latency and thus it is
   extremely important that the most significant data can always be
   delivered in a real-time fashion. Besides, data transmission may suffer
   from deep fading and packets loss due to the dynamic on-body channel
   induced by movements and surrounding environment. Hence,
   energy-efficient medium access control (MAC) is crucially needed to
   allocate transmission bandwidth and to ensure reliable transmission
   considering WBAN contexts, i.e., time-varying human and environment
   conditions. To improve both efficiency and reliability, we investigate
   the challenges in the development of WBAN MAC design. Furthermore, based
   on the traffic nature and channel status, we introduce a context-aware
   MAC protocol to meet time-varying requirements of WBAN. We have
   demonstrated that the proposed protocol is able to reduce latency,
   energy consumption, and packet loss rate, as well as to achieve a
   reasonable trade-off between efficiency and reliability.},

Abstract = {The implementation of IEEE 802.15.6 in Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN)
   is contention based. Meanwhile, IEEE 802.15.4 MAC provides limited 16
   channels in the Superframe structure, making it unfit for N
   heterogeneous nature of patient's data. Also, the Beacon-enabled
   Carrier-Sense Multiple Access/Collision-Avoidance (CSMA/CA) scheduling
   access scheme in WBAN, allocates Contention-free Period (CAP) channels
   to emergency and non-emergency Biomedical Sensors (BMSs) using
   contention mechanism, increasing repetition in rounds. This reduces
   performance of the MAC protocol causing higher data collisions and
   delay, low data reliability, BMSs packet retransmissions and increased
   energy consumption. Moreover, it has no traffic differentiation method.
   This paper proposes a Low-delay Traffic-Aware Medium Access Control
   (LTA-MAC) protocol to provide sufficient channels with a higher
   bandwidth, and allocates them individually to non-emergency and
   emergency data. Also, a Contention Differentiated Adaptive Slot
   Allocation CSMA-CA (CDASA-CSMA/CA) for scheduling access scheme is
   proposed to reduce repetition in rounds, and assists in channels
   allocation to BMSs. Furthermore, an On-demand (OD) slot in the LTA-MAC
   to resolve the patient's data drops in the CSMA/CA scheme due to
   exceeding of threshold values in contentions is introduced. Simulation
   results demonstrate advantages of the proposed schemes over the IEEE
   802.15.4 MAC and CSMA/CA scheme in terms of success rate, packet
   delivery delay, and energy consumption.},

Abstract = {In IEEE 802.15.4 wireless personal area networks (WPANs), reliable data
   transmission is highly valued for health and medical information. The
   channel access in IEEE 802.15.4 employs Carrier Sense Multiple Access
   with Collision Avoidance (CSMA). In IEEE 802.15.4 WPANs, health and
   medical information are expected to transmit reliably to a single
   central controller (i.e., coordinator). However, due to CSMA/CA, the
   important data that informs the patient's emergency situation of the
   coordinator could not be transmitted. It is because CSMA/CA impairs
   network efficiency. Therefore, a more effective frame transmission
   scheme should be proposed to provide reliable frame transmission and
   solve contention problems for Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs). In
   this paper, based on IEEE 802.15.4, we propose a Backoff Counter
   Reservation (BCR) scheme. We propose that the next backoff value is
   added to the MAC payload of each transmitted data frame in order to the
   coordinator could know their future backoff duration information. If the
   data frame does not arrive at the predicted transmission slot, a
   guaranteed time slot (GTS) is allocated to the sensor in the next
   superframe. In this scheme, a sensor can reserve a backoff counter for
   next packet transmission. An analytic model and a simulation model are
   developed to evaluate the performance of IEEE 802.15.4 and BCR. The
   simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly
   improves throughput, delay and collision probability. Our proposed
   scheme significantly outperforms IEEE 802.15.4 backoff scheme.},

Abstract = {Integration of miniature sensors composes a wireless body area network
   (WBAN), which enables remote health monitoring. To make this technology
   widely acceptable in the society, some studies suggest commonly used
   gadgets such as cell phones or laptops as a hub for WBANs. In these
   cases, envisaged medical and non-medical applications of WBANs must have
   the same priority unless in emergency situations. Also, medical
   applications of WBANs need some strict requirements that are not that
   important for non-medical applications, such as very low-power
   consumption or reliability. In addition, channel condition may change in
   WBANs because of fading effects and this causes packet loss. Therefore
   proper traffic prioritisation, high reliability and efficient channel
   utilisation are vitally important issues in these networks. In this
   study, the authors improve the performance of the medium access control
   (MAC) protocol of WBANs using an adaptive resource allocation and
   traffic prioritisation according to the medical situation of user and
   channel condition. Through adaptively separating and managing the
   possible traffics of WBANs, the heterogeneous requirements of different
   applications are provided. Analytical and simulation results show that
   the proposed MAC protocol outperforms IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.15.6
   MAC protocols in terms of power consumption as well as the channel
   utilisation and reliability.},

Abstract = {The backoff algorithm employed by the medium access control (MAC)
   protocol of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard has a significant impact on the
   overall performance of the wireless sensor network (WSN). This algorithm
   helps the MAC protocol resolve the contention among multiple nodes in
   accessing the wireless medium. The standard binary exponent backoff
   (BEB) used by the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC protocol relies on an incremental
   method that doubles the size of the contention window after the
   occurrence of a collision. In a previous work, we proposed the adaptive
   backoff algorithm (ABA), which adapts the contention window's size to
   the value of the probability of collision, thus relating the contention
   resolution to the size of the WSN in an indirect manner. ABA was studied
   and tested using contention window sizes of up to 256. However, the
   latter limit on the contention window size led to degradation in the
   network performance as the size of the network exceeded 50 nodes. This
   paper introduces the Improved ABA (I-ABA), an improved version of ABA.
   In the design of I-ABA we observe the optimal values of the contention
   window that maximize performance under varying probabilities of
   collision. Based on that, we use curve fitting techniques to derive a
   mathematical expression that better describes the adaptive change in the
   contention window. This forms the basis of I-ABA, which demonstrates
   scalability and the ability to enhance performance. As a potential area
   of application for I-ABA, we target wireless body area networks (WBANs)
   that are large-scale, that is, composed of hundreds of sensor nodes.
   WBAN is a major application area for the emerging Internet of Things
   (IoT) paradigm. We evaluate the performance of I-ABA based on
   simulations. Our results show that, in a large-scale WBAN, I-ABA can
   achieve superior performance to both ABA and the standard BEB in terms
   of various performance metrics.},

Abstract = {Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is gaining significant popularity due
   to its applications in smart health. It facilitates efficient,
   cost-effective, ubiquitous, and unobtrusive remote e-health monitoring.
   Similar to other networks such as Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and
   Ad-hoc Network, WBAN challenges include Postural Body Movement,
   Temperature Rise and Interference, Network Lifetime, and QoS. However,
   due to its stricter resource constrains in terms of transmit power and
   environmental requirement especially for nodes implanted in the body, an
   energy and Quality of Service aware routing protocol was developed in
   this paper. The algorithm decreases the frequent recharging and
   replacing of sensors nodes. The routing protocol works as follows:
   first, the sensor node senses the data and the data is classified into
   emergency, low-emergency and normal data by a Modified-MAC protocol
   referred to as M-MAC. Next, the emergency data is transmitted using
   single-hop transmission in order to deliver the data in on time, normal
   data is not transmitted so as to save energy and the low-emergency data
   is transmitted using another new developed algorithm called Weight-based
   optimal energy and QoS algorithm (W-QoS) which select the optimal route
   to send the data to the sink node. By enabling W-QoS to transmit
   low-emergency data, network lifetime and QoS is improved. This work is
   validated by comparing the network lifetime, delay and through to that
   of similar works, and our work outperforms all similar works. The
   performance was evaluated using OMNeT++ simulation environment.},

Abstract = {Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) can provide real-time and reliable
   health monitoring, attributing to the human-centered and sensor
   interoperability properties. WBANs have become a key component of the
   ubiquitous eHealth (electronic health) revolution that prospers on the
   basis of information and communication technologies. The prime
   consideration in WBAN is how to maximize the network lifetime with
   battery-powered sensor nodes in energy constraint. Novel solutions in
   Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols are imperative to satisfy the
   particular BAN scenario and the need of excellent energy efficiency in
   healthcare applications. In this paper, we propose a hybrid Lifetime
   Extended Directional Approach (LEDA) MAC protocol based on IEEE 802.15.6
   to reduce energy consumption and prolong network lifetime. The LEDA MAC
   protocol takes full advantages of directional superiority in energy
   saving that employs multi-beam directional mode in Carrier Sense
   Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) and single-beam
   directional mode in Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) for alternative
   in data reservation and transmission according to the traffic varieties.
   Moreover, the impacts of some inherent problems of directional antennas
   such as deafness and hidden terminal problem can be decreased owing to
   that all nodes generate individual beam according to user priorities
   designated. Furthermore, LEDA MAC employs a Dynamic Polled Allocation
   Period (DPAP) for burst data transmissions to increase the network
   reliability and adaptability. Extensive analysis and simulation results
   show that the proposed LEDA MAC protocol achieves extended network
   lifetime with improved performance compared with IEEE 802.15.6.},

   energy-efficient MAC scheduling mechanism which is capable of meeting
   strict QoS requirements. In this paper, special characteristics of WBAN
   channels, namely, the slow fading, the periodicity of fading, and the
   correlation among the channels have been exploited to formulate the
   sensor scheduling problem as a partially observable Markov decision
   problem (POMDP). Specific algorithms based on value iteration and
   pruning have been proposed in order to reduce the computational burden
   associated with the corresponding POMDP. The proposed scheduling
   mechanism is compared against a TDMA scheduling for a three-sensor
   network, and an average 22-32\% improvement in energy consumption and
   slight improvement in reliability is reported.},

Abstract = {Recently, the application range of WBAN has been gradually expanding due
   to the advanced wireless telecommunication techniques and the activated
   ubiquitous environment. WBAN is a network environment in which various
   types of medical or non-medical signal created directly or indirectly in
   and out of the body are measured and processed for transmission to
   various mobile device nearby. The MAC protocol proposed in this paper is
   in form of TDMA based technique in CSMA/CA environment. The proposed
   scheme applies the maximum delay restriction to each type of data
   packets in order to deal with the delayed packets due to the collision
   from the transmission of two or more packets at the same time. We
   compare the packet delay with the random selection based scheme
   according to the variation of total offered data traffic. The effect to
   the packet delay is analyzed in case we consider the delay requirement
   and the adaptive scheme is needed to cope with the high and mixed data
   traffic in future WBAN based network environment.},

Abstract = {In this paper, a generic wake-up radio (WUR) based medium access control
   (MAC) protocol (GWR-MAC) has been evaluated from the energy consumption
   point of view. GWR-MAC protocol's goal is to achieve energy efficiency
   by avoiding idle listening since the sensor nodes are awakened only when
   there is a need for communication. A successful wake-up signal (WUS)
   transmission and reception is needed to awaken the WUR enabled node(s)
   from the sleep mode which must be taken into account in the energy
   consumption evaluation. Success of wake-up process depends on the
   physical layer detection of the signal, and also on the collision
   probability of the wake-up signals if there can be multiple nodes that
   are transmitting the WUS approximately at the same time. The success
   probability of GWR-MAC wake-up process is analyzed in this work taking
   into account physical and MAC layer aspects when assuming that wake-up
   signals are transmitted using Aloha channel access method. WUS success
   probability derivation is incorporated to energy consumption model and
   results are obtained to compare the total energy consumption of WUR
   based network and duty-cycling based network The results show that the
   WUR based networks can improve energy efficiency in comparison to
   conventional duty cycling approach when taking into account also the
   error probability of the wake-up process. Results show also that in
   which conditions the duty-cycling approach should be preferred instead
   of WUR approach},

Abstract = {Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) have lately attracted many researchers
   as a relatively new phenomenon that mainly emerged with the development
   of the wireless communication technologies and sensor devices to be able
   to fit in a person's body. WBAN's primary concerns range from energy
   efficient communication to designing delays efficient protocols that
   face human body mobility. In this work, we propose an efficient
   converge-cast, i.e data collection, protocol, e-CLDC. Our protocol is
   based on a cross-layer approach that involves Physical, MAC and Network
   layers. e-CLDC implements a multi-hop multi-path strategy to increase
   reliability and energy efficiency at network layer. A scheduling
   mechanism is also adopted at the MAC layer to avoid collisions and
   overhearing. In addition, sensor nodes adjust dynamically their
   transmission power and adapt it regarding the body posture at physical
   layer. e-CLDC achieves an average of 99\% reliability for different body
   postures. Our protocol performances are compared to a one-hop strategy.
   The latter achieves only 64\% and thus with a high sensors transmission
   power.},

Abstract = {Reliability stands as the first important factor when dealing with
   medical data within the context of a wireless body area network (WBAN).
   The sensor nodes on body send their data to the coordinator based on a
   beacon-enabled access mode defined in IEEE 802.15.4 medium access
   control (MAC) specifications. This paper studies an effective backoff
   resolution into the carrier sense multiple access with collision
   avoidance (CSMA/CA) procedure of the beacon-enabled access mode of IEEE
   802.15.4. Whilst the standard introduces the backoff as a resolution to
   less probability of identical backoffs, it does not address the
   efficiency of the generated backoff time in non-identical backoff
   situations. This phenomenon degrades the reliability of the received
   data at the coordinator device. A dynamic and reliable MAC algorithm for
   WBAN is presented in which length of the backoff period for each node
   gets decided based on its past successful trials in accessing the
   channel and also its data rate. This encourages a fair access to the
   medium among all the sensor nodes as moderate backoff values are
   assigned to each node. The primary contributions in this paper are less
   delay endured and higher data reliability while making no changes to the
   level of energy efficiency.},

Abstract = {Wireless body area networks (WBANs) can be widely used in wireless
   medical, motion detection etc. However, the existence of interference
   results in the increase in energy consumption and delay. To mitigate
   interference, nodes are prevented from using the same or similar
   spectrum resources by adopting multi-channel media access control (MAC)
   protocols. Here, the authors propose a multi-channel MAC protocol
   towards energy efficiency and low interference (EIMAC). Firstly, the
   states of each channel are clarified by the channel mapping mechanism. A
   novel channel selection strategy, considering the unfairness between
   high or low priorities, then is carried out. After that, considering the
   characteristics of node including residual energy, user priority, and
   data volume, the authors propose a low energy consumption enabled
   transmission mechanism. Lastly, the authors utilise a novel collision
   avoidance mechanism to reduce the collision probability of packets.
   Numerical results show that EIMAC significantly enhance the performance
   of WBANs in terms of delay, throughput, and energy consumption.},

Abstract = {Ultra-wide band (UWB) is a promising radio technology to transmit huge
   data in short distances between different digital devices or between
   individual components of a personal computer. Due to the magnificent
   features of UWB technology, it finds vast research and application
   interests, such as Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPANs), Wireless
   Sensor Networks (WSNs), Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) as a special
   case of WSNs, and Wireless Area Networks (WLANs) as well. In this
   article, we study the assumptions and performance metrics related to
   recent schemes of Medium Access Control (MAC) Protocols employed in UWB
   applications that aim to improve its performance. Also, we compare the
   different approaches used in the recent works based on 10 parameters:
   application domain, cast type, protocol centralization, number of hops,
   mobility, number of used channels, uniformity, priority, and analytical
   approach. Finally, we introduce different approaches to improve UWB

Abstract = {A Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is the composition of a group of
   energy-efficient, miniature, invasive/non-invasive, light-weighted
   sensors that monitor human body health conditions for early detection
   and treatment for life-threatening diseases. Due to the stringent
   demands of WBAN, such as energy efficiency, reliability and low delay,
   the development of an efficient contention control algorithm is
   exceptionally crucial that aims to maximize throughput by reducing
   collisions. In this context, this paper proposes an adaptive algorithm,
   namely, Prioritization and Contention Control (PCC) algorithm, to
   minimize collisions, latency and energy consumption. The first phase of
   the proposed algorithm prioritizes sensors using run-time metrics to
   grant channel access only for the potential nodes to send their data. It
   leads to a lesser number of collisions among sensors, thereby reducing
   retransmission attempts. In the second phase, the Contention Window (CW)
   size is predicted using queue length and collision rate that accurately
   mimic the current channel status. The dynamic estimation of CW aids in
   minimizing channel access delay, collisions and energy consumption,
   thereby enhancing overall network performance. The performance of the
   proposed PCC algorithm is validated with the 2D Markov model and NS2
   simulation in terms of throughput, packet delivery ratio, delay and
   remaining energy.},

Abstract = {Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is a modern technology having a
   wide-range of applications. Reliability is a key performance index for
   WBANs, especially for medical applications. An unreliable WBAN may
   severely affect the patient under observation. Main causes of
   unreliability are inefficient routing, low transmission range, body
   shadowing and environmental interference. We propose a Cross-Layer
   Opportunistic MAC/Routing (COMR) protocol that can improve the
   reliability by using a timer based approach for the relay selection
   mechanism. The value of this timer depends on Received Signal Strength
   Indicator (RSSI) and residual energy. The selected relay node will have
   the highest residual energy and will be closest to the sink as compared
   to other possible relay nodes. We evaluate the performance of the
   proposed mechanism in terms of network lifetime, Packet Delivery Ratio
   (PDR), End-To-End (ETE) delay, and energy used per bit. Results depict
   that COMR protocol shows improvement in terms of reliability, energy
   efficiency, ETE delay and network lifetime in a WBAN as compared to
   Simple Opportunistic Routing (SOR).},

Abstract = {In WBAN, energy efficiency is a major concern. The sensor nodes attached
   to the human body are battery-powered devices with a finite lifespan.
   These sensor nodes assist in gathering biological data from the human
   body and transmitting it to a control device. In WBAN, the MAC protocol
   is critical in evaluating a protocol's energy efficiency. Traditional
   MAC protocols aim to boost throughput and bandwidth efficiency. The most
   critical aspect is that they lack in energy conserving mechanism. By
   employing correct control techniques that aid in the efficient use of
   energy resources, the useful network life time can be extended. Several
   MAC protocols for WBAN have been devised to reduce energy consumption,
   and packet collision, idle listening, overhearing, and control packet
   overhead are the main causes of energy waste in wireless networks. Idle
   listening, packet overhead, overhearing, and collision rate are all
   addressed by the energy-saving technique. In WBAN, we introduced a novel
   energy-efficient MAC protocol called Scheduled Access MAC (SAMAC) to
   extend the network life time without sacrificing QoS. Using the Castalia
   simulator, we analyze and compare the performance of our proposed SAMAC
   to that of the BaselineMAC (IEEE 802.15.6) and ZigBeeMAC (IEEE 802.15.4)
   in terms of energy consumption, packet delivery ratio, and end-to-end
   delay. In terms of both energy conversion and WBAN Quality of Service,
   our simulation results suggest that our proposed SAMAC is more efficient
   than Baseline MAC and ZigBeeMAC.},

   User Priorities (UPs) in analytical and simulation models to evaluate
   the MAC performance. We study how varying Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of
   all UPs affects the MAC performance. Our results indicate that data
   frame sizes and channel quality between a node and the hub are the most
   effective parameters on PHY/MAC performance of a WBAN.},

Abstract = {As the world's population rises, the healthcare system experiences
   significant changes. Wireless body area network (WBAN) is an emerging
   technology that has considerable impact on medical and non-medical
   applications. However, two crucial challenges in WBANs are interference
   minimization and channel assignment. High interference may increase
   collision probability, transmission delay, and energy consumption.
   Multichannel schemes are proposed to reduce the data transmission
   latency and improve the system throughput by allowing simultaneous
   transmission of sensors in coexisting WBANs. When WBAN users move, they
   need to switch the channels frequently to avoid potential channel
   conflicts and to maintain the Quality of Service (QoS). However,
   frequent switching may raise energy consumption and aggravate delay.
   Existing multichannel assignment schemes failed to perform well in
   highly dynamic and densely deployed WBANs environments. In contrast to
   existing studies, this paper proposes a Prediction-based Channel
   Assignment (PCA) algorithm that selects the channels for WBANs to remain
   valid for future time instances and thus minimizes the delay and number
   of channel switches for dynamic and coexisting WBANs. When a WBAN needs
   to switch a channel, the proposed method predicts the future neighbors
   of that WBAN based on its history. It explores the channel information
   of present and future neighbors to select a suitable channel with higher
   resilience in a dynamic environment. Thus, our algorithm minimizes
   channel interference by avoiding unnecessary channel switching. We have
   used machine learning algorithms to predict the future neighbors of a
   WBAN. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm performs
   better than an existing algorithm and random channel assignment in delay
   and throughput.},

Abstract = {Along with the increase of people's urge for health care, e-health, as a
   term for healthcare practice supported by electronic processes and
   communication, attracts more and more attentions. Wireless Body Area
   Network (WBAN) built on IEEE 802.15.6 is an excellent solution for
   e-health on account of its medical applications. Extensive researches of
   the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol in WBAN put emphasis on single
   channel. This may result in inevitable interference and bring channel
   collision and energy inefficiency. In addition, traditional Carrier
   Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) utilized in
   single channel results in the large packet delay and energy consumption
   for overhearing. This cannot meet the request of medical data
   communication. To address these issues, we propose an energy-delay
   efficient multi-channel MAC (ED-MAC) protocol. In our scheme, (i) the
   channels are classified into control channel and data ones; (ii) nodes
   contend to reserve data channels in control channel while transmit data
   frames through the specified data channels; (iii) the value of
   Contention Window (CW) in CSMA/CA is adjusted to accommodate the ED-MAC
   protocol better. Simulation results show that our ED-MAC scheme
   significantly decreases the packet delay and improves the throughput,
   channel utilization and energy efficiency.},

Abstract = {The significant advances in the Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) and
   the impact of internetwork interference caused by the combination of
   several WBANs, the performance accuracy of WBANs may suffer
   significantly. In this article, a Hybrid Energy-Efficient Multi-Channel
   Communication Protocol (HEEMCCP) is proposed to mitigate and avoid
   inter-WBAN interference. The Dynamic Interference Avoidance Algorithm
   (DIAMA) reduces intra-WBAN interference and consumes less energy by
   dynamically adjusting the Superframe (SF) distance and restricting the
   number of channels to two. Rescheduling or channel switching is proposed
   when WBAN performance falls below tolerance using the neighborhood
   Sensor Node (SN) list set up using Optimum Interference Mitigation
   Algorithm (OIMA). The simulation results show that WBAN performance
   parameters and End-to-End Delay (EED) and Energy Residual (ER) are
   decreased. The system throughput improved significantly up to 60\% in
   high-interference situations.},

Abstract = {Wireless body area networks are captivating growing interest because of
   their suitability for wide range of applications. However, network
   lifetime is one of the most prominent barriers in deploying these
   networks for most applications. Moreover, most of these applications
   have stringent QoS requirements such as delay and throughput. In this
   paper, the modified superframe structure of IEEE 802.15.4 based MAC
   protocol is proposed which addresses the aforementioned problems and
   improves the energy consumption efficiency. Moreover, priority
   guaranteed CSMA/CA mechanism is used where different priorities are
   assigned to body nodes by adjusting the data type and size. In order to
   save energy, a wake-up radio based mechanism to control sleep and active
   modes of body sensors are used. Furthermore, a discrete time finite
   state Markov model to find the node states is used. Analytical
   expressions are derived to model and analyze the behavior of average
   energy consumption, throughput, packet drop probability, and average
   delay during normal and emergency data. Extensive simulations are
   conducted for analysis and validation of the proposed mechanism. Results
   show that the average energy consumption and delay are relatively higher
   during emergency data transmission with acknowledgment mode due to data
   collision and retransmission.},

Abstract = {While many of the technologies envisaged for use in wireless healthcare
   systems are available today little is known about their interplay. The
   collected medical data in a Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) must be
   transferred to a medical center for further processing and storage.
   Therefore, second wireless hop is needed before access to the wired
   network is achieved. The main focus of this research is to investigate
   the performance of interconnection between patient's IEEE 802.15.6-based
   WBAN and the stationary (e.g., hospital room or ward) IEEE 802.11e-based
   Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN). We introduce a Quality of Service
   (QoS)-based bridging mechanism between the WBANs and the WLAN to
   interconnect human body monitoring networks and the WLAN access point.
   We use strong prioritizing parameters among 8 traffic priorities in WBAN
   as recommended by the standard. However, we deploy Arbitrary Inter-Frame
   Space (AIFS) for differentiating the WLAN Access Categories (ACs) to
   provide relatively mild differentiation and decrease the frame collision
   probability. By employing simulation models we investigate the impacts
   of network and prioritizing Medium Access Control (MAC) parameters on
   the bridges' performance. The results of the paper indicate the large
   impact of the numbers of WBANs and regular WLAN nodes and their traffic
   rates on the healthcare network performance. In addition, the
   performance is significantly improved by setting appropriate MAC
   parameters for the network and deploying aggregation mechanisms.},

Title = {A priority based energy harvesting scheme for charging embedded sensor
   nodes in wireless body area networks},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 22},
Abstract = {This research work proposes a novel priority aware schedule based
   charging algorithm that uses wireless power transfer (WPT) technique in
   order to charge embedded sensor nodes (SNs) in a wireless body area
   network (WBAN). Implanted sensor nodes in WBANs require energy for both
   information extraction and data transmission to the remote controller
   unit. Thus, energy shortage of these SNs deteriorates due to the data
   transmission process of the patient health monitoring system. However,
   continuous operation by means of electromagnetic induction for energy
   harvesting, obtained from ambient sources, reduces the overall
   efficiency of the primary unit. With this paradigm in sight, an
   algorithm demonstrating the modeling of a priority-based mechanism is
   proposed in order to ensure proper sensor voltage level and to reduce
   the transmission losses. Medium access control (MAC) protocols are used
   for inductive powering from the primary unit to the secondary unit in a
   collision-free centralized scheduling scheme. Therefore, the proposed
   wireless charging algorithm for implanted SNs in WBAN is designed as per
   carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA)
   technique. Because of this, the overall power consumption of SNs for
   certain operation periods, successful charging probabilities for
   multiple SNs, and instantaneous power requirements are considered as key
   performance measures of analysis. It is assumed that proper energy
   storage in both transmitters and receivers can handle channel
   interference and traffic contention. Simulation results verify that a
   significant reduction in power consumption for the proposed priority
   aware algorithm will maintain almost similar output. For this reason,
   saturating class-C as well as class-E driver circuits have been used to
   justify the performance in two different circuit topologies. Effects of
   priority with respect to the full charge period have also been observed
   for the multi-node system. Furthermore, from performance analysis, it
   has been demonstrated that the scheduling scheme causes both single
   MOSFET composed saturating class-C and L-choke modeled class-E
   associated driver circuits to be considerably more loss efficient than
   corresponding existing ones.},

Abstract = {Wireless body area network (WBAN) collects significant signals of human
   body or environment information for health monitoring or professional
   services. But normal medium access protocols can hardly make a balance
   and ensure enough reliability of a network because there are specific
   features and service quality in WBAN applications. Contention access or
   fixed allocation of bandwidth cannot meet all nodes' requirements and
   may cause collisions and delay. Especially in emergency medical
   situations, some data must be transmitted immediately for accurate
   diagnosis and decision. The dropping of critical messages could possibly
   create life threatening results. In order to improve the reliability and
   efficiency of data transmission in WBAN, this paper proposes a fuzzy
   control medium access (FCMA) mechanism based on input parameters for
   performance gains. It controls the contention window in contention
   access period (CAP) and slots allocation in contention free period (CFP)
   according to nodes' status. Through simulation analysis, the improved
   performance of throughput, latency, and packets breakdown is
   demonstrated by efficient usage of bandwidth and avoidance of collision.

Abstract = {Time-based localization in Wireless Body Area Networks ( WBANs), has
   attracted growing research interest for the last past years. Nodes
   positions can be estimated based on peer-to-peer radio transactions
   between devices. Indeed, the accuracy of the localization process could
   be highly affected by different factors, such as the WBAN channels where
   the signal is propagating through, as well as the nodes mobility that
   bias the peer-to-peer range estimation, and thus, the final achieved
   localization accuracy. The goal of this paper consists in characterizing
   the impact of mobility and WBAN channel on the ranging and localization
   estimation, based on real mobility traces acquired through a motion
   capture system. More specifically, the ranging error is evaluated over
   all the WBANs links ( i.e. on-body, off-body and body-to-body links),
   while an impulse Radio Ultra-Wideband ( IR-UWB) physical layer, as well
   as a TDMA-based Medium Access Control ( MAC) are playing on. The
   simulation results show that the range measurement error can be modeled
   as a Gaussian distribution. To deal with the gaussianity observation of
   ranging error and to provide high positioning accuracy, an adjustable
   extended Kalman Filter ( EKF) is proposed.},

Abstract = {The coexisting wireless body area networks (WBAN) is a very challenging
   issue because of strong inter-networks interference, which seriously
   affects energy consumption and spectrum utilization ratio. In this
   paper, we study a power control strategy with nearest neighbor nodes
   distribution for coexisting WBAN based on stochastic geometry. Using
   homogeneous Poisson point processes (PPP) model, the relationship
   between the transmission power and the networks distribution is
   analytically derived to reduce interference to other devices. The goal
   of this paper is to increase the transmission success probability and
   throughput through power control strategy. In addition, we evaluate the
   area spectral efficiency simultaneously active WBAN in the same channel
   Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the power
   control algorithm.},

Abstract = {The advance in technologies of wireless sensor network (WSN) prompts the
   development of healthcare and, as a result, many wireless healthcare
   applications are springing up. In many scenarios, it is very common that
   nodes have the capability of mobility. For example, the nodes in body
   area networks move together with the movement of users. The MAC protocol
   in such applications should take the group mobility into account. We
   introduce a simple MAC protocol which combines TDMA and FDMA to deal
   with the mobile clusters in wireless sensor networks. Our solution is
   that the nodes are classified into two different sub-networks according
   to their mobility. The two sub-networks utilize different frequencies to
   communicate and then, through the cooperation between the two networks,
   the uploading of packets sensed is achieved. It is an efficient way to
   avoid collision and interference brought by a mobile cluster.},

Title = {Priority-Aware Price-Based Power Control for Co-Located WBANs Using
   Stackelberg and Bayesian Games},
Journal = {SENSORS},

Abstract = {According to the IEEE 802.15.6 standard, interference within each
   wireless body area network (WBAN) can be well addressed by the time
   division multiple access (TDMA)-based media access control (MAC)
   protocol. However, the inter-WBAN interference will be caused after
   multiple WBANs are gathered together. This paper proposes a
   priority-aware price-based power control (PPPC) scheme for mitigating
   the inter-WBAN interference. Specifically, to maximize the transmission
   data rate of sensors and control the aggregate interference suffered by
   coordinators, a Stackelberg game is established, in which the
   coordinators issue interference prices and the active sensors adjust
   their transmission power accordingly. On the other hand, since the
   information about the identities of the active sensors in a specific
   time slot is kept private, a Bayesian game is designed to model the
   interaction among sensors. Moreover, the timeliness and reliability of
   data transmission are guaranteed by designing the sensors' priority
   factors and setting a priority-related active probability for each
   sensor. At last, a power control algorithm is designed to obtain optimal
   strategies of game players. Simulation results show that compared with
   other existing schemes, the proposed scheme achieves better fairness
   with a comparable network sum data rate and is more energy efficient.},

Abstract = {Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) consists of miniaturized, tiny, low
   power body sensor nodes communicating with a BAN (Body Area Node)
   Coordinator through Radio Frequency (RF) interface link. Recent
   advancements in the field of Information, Communication and
   microelectronics have led to the realization of WBAN, which will help in
   hazardous, long term health monitoring especially for elderly people.
   Most of the present day's Body Area Network node's MAC/PHY protocols are
   built using IEEE 802.15.4 and ZigBee standard. This standard will surely
   make an impact through its improvisation especially in MAC/PHY layers in
   the days to come. Already researchers have been working on the new WBAN
   standard. This paper emphasizes the basic structure of IEEE 802.15.5
   MAC/PHY layers through experimentation on 7 specific, static body sensor
   nodes placed at appropriate points on the human body transmitting
   heterogeneous data using Time division multiple access and Contention
   access period of CSMA/CA protocol. The body area channels are considered
   with temporal and fixed path loss values. Physical layer parameters such
   as latency and fade depth distribution, MAC packets received and
   breakdown packets of MAC layer are presented. Packet with respect to the
   unique and useful parameters, packet received from Media Access Control
   layer of each node under various conditions of the channel and with
   Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance comparing with Time
   Division Multiple Access techniques. Experimental results show that a
   transmitting-12dBm to-15dBm was found to be suitable for energy
   efficient WBAN system. For TDMA scheme, the algorithm may be fine-tuned
   to reduce the number of packet failure which improves the energy
   efficiency for any kind of channel},

Title = {BNS: A Framework for Wireless Body Area Network Realistic Simulations},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Simulation is a useful and common technique to evaluate the performance
   of networks when the implementation of a real scenario is not available.
   Specifically for Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN), it is crucial to
   perform evaluations in environments as close as possible to the real
   conditions of use. To achieve that, simulations must include different
   protocol layers involved in WBAN and models close to reality to create
   realistic simulation environments for e-health applications. To satisfy
   these needs, this work presents the BNS framework, a flexible tool for
   WBAN simulations. The proposal is an extension of the Castalia
   framework, which includes: (1) a new wireless channel model considering
   real radio-propagation over the human body; (2) an updated
   implementation of the WBAN MAC protocol in Castalia, with
   functionalities and requirements in accordance with the IEEE 802.15.6
   standard; (3) a new comprehensive and configurable mobility model for
   simulating intra-WBAN communication; (4) a temperature module based on
   the Pennes bioheat transfer equation, to model the temperature of a WBAN
   node based on the activity of the node; and (5) a Healthcare Application
   Layer that implements data representation and a communication protocol
   between Personal Health Devices (PHD) following the ISO/IEEE 11073
   standard. Three use cases are presented, where WBAN scenarios are
   simulated and evaluated using the proposed BNS framework. Results show
   that BNS is a valid and flexible tool to evaluate WBAN solutions through
   simulation.},

   shows how the relevance can be exploited on the Medium Access Control

   is developed for sensor scheduling under an operation cost constraint.
   It is shown that the compact subset of sensors can be found to provide
   necessary information for timely and correct diagnoses. Based on the
   theoretical framework, an algorithm combining sensor selection and

Abstract = {Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) consists of a set of sensor nodes
   deployed on or implanted in the body and these nodes send sensed
   physiological data to the personal assistant. Some of these sensor nodes
   can be located far from the personal assistant or due to body posture
   the link between the node and the personal assistant is obstructed and
   so require an intermediate node to help relay their data. As defined in
   the IEEE 802.15.6 standard, a node can initiate the two-hop extension
   cooperative communication to relay other nodes data. However, it is
   impossible to accept relaying for more than one node at the same time.
   In addition, when a relay node has data to send too, it has to choose
   either to leave the relaying mode or to maintain it. In this paper we
   propose a Decode and Merge technique that maintains the relaying mode by
   merging frames from relayed and relaying nodes. By doing so, a MAC
   format resizing is required. Apart from maintaining cooperative
   communication, this technique increases the general throughput without
   increasing the energy consumption, management and control flows.
   Furthermore, it increases the ability to resist against interference.},

Abstract = {Wireless body area networks (WBANs) comprise several sensor nodes
   equipped with a short range radio-frequency transceiver, implanted
   and/or attached to the human body. Their low form-factor and
   localization imply less resources available and limited energy
   capabilities. Therefore, energy efficiency of WBANs is a critical issue
   since, in many cases, batteries cannot be replaced or recharged,
   requiring mechanisms to extend their lifetime. The aim of transmission
   power control (TPC) mechanisms, which can be combined with other
   energy-saving mechanisms, is to reduce the energy consumption, external
   interferences, and specific-observation-rate in wireless communications
   by dynamically adjusting the transmission power output of data
   transmission, with the minimum effect on other performance aspects, such
   as reliability and latency. This paper describes and analyzes the TPCs
   developed as a result of a synergy created by two mechanisms, a link
   quality estimator and the transmission power level control. Design
   choices, in terms of the solutions devised to each mechanism, as well
   as, the strategy adopted to combine them in a TPC, are highlighted. A
   comparison between the newest and the most relevant research works in
   this area is provided as a guideline to future research. A taxonomy to
   classify the different TPC mechanisms developed is proposed.},

Abstract = {Recently, the application range of WBAN has been gradually expanding due
   to the advanced wireless telecommunication teehniques and the activated
   ubiquitous environment. WBAN is a network environment in which various
   types of medical or non-medical signal created direetly or indirectly in
   and out of the body are measured and processed for transmission to
   various mobile device nearby. The MAC protocol proposed in this paper is
   in form ofTDMA based technique in CSMA/CA environment. The proposed
   scheme applies the maximum delay restriction to each type of data
   packets in order to deal with the delayed packets due to the collision
   from the transmission of two or more packets at the same time. We
   compare the packet delay with the random selection based scheme
   according to the variation of total offered data traffic. The effect to
   the packet delay is analyzed in ease we consider the delay requirement
   and the adaptive scheme is needed to cope with the high and mixed data
   traffic in future WBAN based network environment.},

Abstract = {A fast growing class of sensing technology is wearable, where network
   nodes are tightly coupled with the human body. Wireless body area
   networks (WBAN) technology has gained popularity over the last few
   years, with a wide range of applications covered, in particular in
   health and rehabilitation. Wearable and pervasive computing are able to
   sense, monitor and process the data to provide smart assistance and
   context-aware ambient intelligence environments. However present-day
   WBAN devices are mainly battery-powered and due to energy issue they
   need to be recharged every day or even hours and thus they miss the
   expectations for a truly unobtrusive user experience. This work presents
   a novel energy-efficient asynchronous MAC protocol using a nano-watt
   wake up radio with addressing capabilities to reduce the energy
   consumption of the communication and then extend the WBAN life time. We
   present the benefits of the wake up radio in a star topology widely used
   in WBAN where the number of the node is around 5 to 10. The implemented
   protocol exploiting the low power consumption of the wake up radio, the
   low latency and the addressing capabilities can increase significantly
   the energy efficiency of the single node and entire network reducing
   both idle listening and data collisions. Result based on measured power
   consumption and OMNET++ simulation demonstrate that by using the wake up
   radio it is possible to reduce the power consumption up to 150 times
   compared to related protocols and the lifetime can be significantly
   increased in a real world scenario.},

Abstract = {Performance evaluation of Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) is
   primarily conducted in terms of simulation based studies. From this
   perspective, recent research has focused on channel modeling, and energy
   conservation at Network/MAC layer. Most of these studies ignore
   collaborative learning and path loss. In this paper, we present
   Link-Aware and Energy Efficient protocol for wireless Body Area networks
   (LAEEBA) and Cooperative Link-Aware and Energy Efficient protocol for
   wireless Body Area networks (Co-LAEEBA) routing schemes. Unlike existing
   schemes, the proposed work factors in collaborative learning and path
   loss. Cost functions are introduced to learn and select the most
   feasible route from a given node to sink while sharing each others
   distance and residual energy information. Simulation results show
   improved performance of the proposed protocols in comparison to the
   selected existing ones in terms of the chosen performance metrics. (C)

Abstract = {The Wireless Body Sensor Networks (WBSN) have witnessed tremendous
   research interest because of their wide range of applications (medical
   and non-medical) in order to improve the quality of life. The healthcare
   applications of WBSN demands dissemination of patient's data, reliably
   and in a timely manner. For this purpose, medical teams may use
   real-time applications for disseminating critical data such as blood
   pressure, ECG, and EEG. The critical data packets are highly delay
   sensitive that must reach intended destination within time constraints.
   Due to the exchange of real-time and multi-media data, some nodes or
   links may experience the significant level of interference in the
   network. Consequently, it results in transmission disruption, random
   number of packet drops, insufficient buffer space and lack of
   availability of bandwidth. Moreover, interference in the network strains
   the communication links, reduces the information delivery capacity of
   the network and leads to high collisions, packet losses, retransmission
   and energy consumption. Therefore, incorporating interference-awareness
   in routing decisions is desirable to enhance the performance of WBSN. In
   this paper, we present an Interference-aware Routing Protocol (I-RP)
   that makes use of composite routing metric incorporating link quality
   (in terms of link delay and interference level) and path length. This
   multi-facet routing strategy makes more informed routing decision
   regarding route selection in a way that, a route with the minimum level
   of interference and path length is selected. Moreover, it also increases
   the link reliability and minimizes the packet losses and retransmission.
   The simulation results demonstrate the improved performance of proposed
   scheme when compared to existing routing scheme in WBSN.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {This paper proposes an emergency Traffic Adaptive MAC (eTA-MAC) protocol
   for WBANs based on Prioritization. The main advantage of the protocol is
   to provide traffic ranking through a Traffic Class Prioritization-based
   slotted-Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance (TCP-CSMA/CA)
   scheme. The emergency traffic is handled through Emergency Traffic Class
   Provisioning-based slotted-CSMA/CA (ETCP-CSMA/CA) scheme. The
   emergency-based traffic adaptivity is provided through Emergency-based
   Traffic Adaptive slotted-CSMA/CA (ETA-CSMA/CA) scheme. The TCP-CSMA/CA
   scheme assigns a distinct, minimized and prioritized backoff period
   range to each traffic class in every backoff during channel access in
   Contention Access Period (CAP). The ETCP-CSMA/CA scheme delivers the
   sporadic emergency traffic that occurs at a single or multiple BMSN(s)
   instantaneously, with minimum delay and packet loss. It does this while
   being aware of normal traffic in the CAP. Then, the ETA-CSMA/CA scheme
   creates a balance between throughput and energy in the sporadic
   emergency situation with energy preservation of normal traffic BMSNs.
   The proposed protocol is evaluated using NS-2 simulator. The results
   indicate that the proposed protocol is better than the existing Medium
   Access Control (MAC) protocols by 86\% decrease in packet delivery
   delay, 61\% increase in throughput, and a 76\% decrease in energy
   consumption.},

Title = {Reliable emergency data transmission using transmission mode selection
   in wireless body area network},
Journal = {COGENT ENGINEERING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},

Month = {DEC 24},
Abstract = {The main differences between wireless body area network (WBAN) and
   wireless sensor network are the sensors in WBAN distributed on the human
   body; therefore, body posture, clothing, muscle movement, body
   temperature, and climatic conditions generally influence the links
   between sensors and destination. Second, data gathered by the sensors
   are related to human life; therefore, it is important to make sure that
   the gathered data should be delivered to destination efficiently. Hence,
   in some cases, single-hop transmission or direct transmission mode (DTM)
   is not sufficient to deliver the data to the destination. In this paper,
   we proposed an emergency-based cooperative communication protocol for
   WBAN, named as Emergency Data Transmission using Transmission Mode
   Selection (ED-TMS) protocol based on the IEEE 802.15.6 CSMA. First, a
   complete study of a system model is inspected in terms of channel path
   loss, successful transmission probability, and the outage probability.
   Second, a mathematical model of the proposed protocol, end-to-end delay,
   and throughput with relay selection (RS) is derived. Third, RS is
   utilized along with ED-TMS, which makes onlythe best relay participate
   in cooperation in a distributed manner. The design objective of the
   ED-TMS is to reduce end-to-end delayand enhance the throughput of direct
   transmission and traditional cooperative communication. The simulation
   and numerical results show that the ED-TMS can enhance network
   performance under general conditions compared to DTM IEEE 802.15.6 CSMA
   and benchmark. The end-to-end delay reductions of ED-TMS with RS with
   respect to DTM, mutual informationincremental cooperative communication,
   and ED-TMS without RS are 24.5\%, 28\%, and 30\%, respectively.},

Abstract = {Wireless body area networks (WBANs) are communication networks of
   sensors (and/or actuators), which can be placed on, inside, or around
   the body and represent a new generation of personal area networks. In
   contrast to the typical wireless sensor networks (WSNs), WBAN sensors
   are tiny and have limited power supply. Due to irregular human body
   movement and WBAN sensor distribution, fading can cause a lot of error,
   which can be determined by measuring the bit error rate (BER). A higher
   BER requires more power. Therefore, to reduce BER, power consumption
   (PC) and duty cycle (DC), a game theory-two master nodes-based
   cooperative protocol (GT-TMNCP) is proposed in this work. DC is enhanced
   by a further 13\% using the proposed GT-TMNCP, leading to a BER
   reduction 3 times greater when compared to TMNCP, and PC improved by
   14\%, lower than with the TMNCP, for shadowing at 5 dB, critical index
   data (IC), IC = 3 and 5, representing maximum critical data. The results
   also demonstrate that BER is reduced up to 8 times, DC is enhanced by
   8\%, and PC by 7\% for shadowing 9 dB, IC = 7, compared to the QoS
   optimisation approach and TMNCP.},

Abstract = {Recently. more and more sensor network research is carried out in the
   area of remote and mobile health systems (mHealth) or Telemedicine
   applications. In these applications the sensors are centered in or on
   the proximity of the human body thereby forming a network called
   Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) that is uniquely important for
   consideration. Hot problems currently researched in this network include
   reliability and energy efficiency of routing protocols. In this paper we
   present the analysis of three prominent routing protocols AODV. DSR and
   DSDV, based on the key characteristics of the WBAN using IEEE 802.15.4
   MAC Protocol. In our experiments, packet delivery ratio and average
   end-end delay were used as the measure for the communication reliability
   and energy savings efficiency, while considering the mobility of the
   nodes. network communication range and the number of nodes. Based on the
   experimental analysis, both AODV and DSR protocols have good
   reliability, while DSDV performed very poorly with over 90 percent
   packet losses largely due to its high routing table overhead.
   Furthermore, in energy savings efficiency. DSR and AODV had similar
   performance while DSDV performed a little poorer.},

Title = {Superframe contention slot scheduling (SCSS): deep reinforcement
   learning-based time slot allocation for wireless body area network},
Journal = {TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {88},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) grabs the attention of researchers as
   it is a needy technology for e-healthcare. Due to its limited protocol
   support, providing Quality of Service (QoS) is a challenging task.
   Despite the previous research, a critical research gap persists in
   superframe time slot allocation to avoid collisions among the Bio Sensor
   Nodes (BSNs). To address this, a robust Superframe Contention Slot
   Scheduling (SCSS) algorithm is proposed to identify potential BSNs to
   occupy slots under the Exclusive Access Period (EAP) slots of the
   superframe. It incorporates a Markov Decision Process (MDP) policy
   function to select these BSNs using several runtime operational
   parameters. The deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm implements
   the MDP process to get the optimized rewards. The proposed algorithm
   adopts sleep schedules and energy harvesting techniques to avoid the
   dead nodes problem. A Two-state Markov Chain (TMC) model is adopted to
   theoretically analyze the expected throughput and loss performance. The
   comprehensive simulation results show a 41.8\% improvement in
   throughput, a 42.62\% reduction in packet loss, a 6.9\% less energy
   consumption, and enhanced overall network performance compared to
   existing protocols.},

Abstract = {The issues inherent in caring for an ever-increasing aged population has
   been the subject of endless debate and continues to be a hot topic for
   political discussion. The use of hospital-based facilities for the
   monitoring of chronic physiological conditions is expensive and ties up
   key healthcare professionals. The introduction of wireless sensor
   devices as part of a Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) integrated within
   an overall eHealth solution could bring a step change in the remote
   management of patient healthcare. Sensor devices small enough to be
   placed either inside or on the human body can form a vital part of an
   overall health monitoring network. An effectively designed energy
   efficient WBAN should have a minimal impact on the mobility and
   lifestyle of the patient. WBAN technology can be deployed within a
   hospital, care home environment or in the patient's own home. This study
   is a review of the existing research in the area of WBAN technology and
   in particular protocol adaptation and energy efficient cross-layer
   design. The research reviews the work carried out across various layers
   of the protocol stack and highlights how the latest research proposes to
   resolve the various challenges inherent in remote continual healthcare

Abstract = {In this paper, interference mitigation and coexistence strategies
   proposed in IEEE 802.15.6 standard are investigated within the context
   of co-channel interference. A comparative evaluation of the reference
   scenario (which does not use any coexistence scheme), two
   non-collaborative (i.e., time shared, random channel) and one implicitly
   collaborative (i.e., CSMA/CA) based coexistence schemes is presented for
   five co-located bodies. Extensive set of physical, medium access control
   (MAC) parameters are invoked to realise a comprehensive study with
   enhanced IEEE 802.15.6 proposed channel models. It is concluded that
   there is trade-off between coexistence schemes. For example, time shared
   and random channel provides much better packet reception ratio (PRR) and
   energy efficiency, though they suffer in meeting the delay constraints
   of the IEEE 802.15.6 standard. Whereas, CSMA/CA based implicit
   collaborative approach is able to achieve the delay requirements
   however, it does not perform well both in terms of PRR and energy
   consumption.},

Title = {IEEE 802.15.6 CSMA/CA access method for WBANs: Performance evaluation
   and new backoff counter selection procedure},
Journal = {COMPUTER NETWORKS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {188},
Month = {APR 7},
Abstract = {Wireless body area networks (WBANs) are supposed to be an effective
   proposition to revolutionize the present and the future of health care
   services. They provide a proactive diagnosis for many deadly diseases,
   as well as remote and real-time monitoring. On the other hand, they
   impose several challenges to the medium access control (MAC) protocols
   design, regarding the energy-efficiency, quality-of-service, priority,
   scalability, reliability, and security. The standardization of the IEEE
   802.15.6 provides new MAC specifications for WBANs, that take these
   issues into account. In the case of the narrowband frequency (402 to 405
   MHz) dedicated to medical applications, the WBAN employs the carrier
   sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) access method:
   the main contention-based access method of the IEEE 802.15.6 MAC
   protocol that supports the unpredictable data traffic. This access
   method suffers from the loss of its performance with the increase of the
   network density. Consequently, evaluating and improving it is important,
   especially with the sensitivity of the medical data it deals with. In
   this paper, we evaluate the performance of the IEEE 802.15.6 CSMA/CA
   access method, through an illustrative case-study, using the statistical
   model-checking (SMC) toolset UPPAAL-SMC. Then, based on the results of
   this evaluation regarding the negative impact of the converged
   contention window (CW) intervals, we propose new ones and a new backoff
   counter (BC) selection procedure. Relevant metrics we use are
   energy-efficiency, throughput, and delay. Finally, we validate the
   performance of our proposition, in comparison to the old one, on the
   same case-study and toolset. Our access method manages to decrease the
   number of collisions and to increase the number of packets successfully
   transmitted.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes the preliminary investigation of rate adaptive error
   correction coding applied to MAC layer of Body Area Network (WBAN).
   Health monitoring is a crucial part of proactive patient treatment. As a
   nature to WBAN communication, there appears severe noise level
   surrounding the human body. The transmission quality is deterred
   according to the present of noise. The issue can be improved by
   appending Error Correction Code (ECC) to the communication message.
   However, such an effort can cause the packet overhead, latency, and more
   energy consumption. To mitigate these disadvantages, the rate adaptive
   of ECC is proposed. The Reed-Solomon (RS) code designed in GF256 has
   been employed in this study. It fits well the maximum MAC length which
   is 255 bytes. In our investigation, several MIT-BIH Arrhythmia databases
   are chosen as input data to represent the patient monitoring condition.
   The Rician fading channel model is involved as its quite nature to WBAN
   characteristic. The codes performances are measured in Bit Error Rate
   (BER) and energy consumption unit.},

Abstract = {The IEEE 802.15.6 standard has the potential to provide cost-effective
   and unobtrusive medical services to individuals with chronic health
   conditions. It is a low-power standard developed for wireless body area
   networks and enables wireless communication inside or near a human body.
   This standard utilizes a Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision
   Avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol to improve network performance under
   different channel access priorities. However, the CSMA/CA proposed in
   the IEEE 802.15.6 standard has poor throughput performance and link
   reliability when some of the nodes deployed on a human body are hidden
   from each other. We employ the RTS/CTS scheme to solve hidden node
   problems in IEEE 802.15.6 networks over a lossy channel. To improve
   performance of the RTS/CTS scheme, we adjust transmission power levels
   of the nodes according to transmission failures. We estimate throughput
   and energy consumption of the proposed model by differentiating several
   parameters, such as contention window size, values of bit error ratios,
   number of nodes in different priority classes. The performance results
   are obtained through analytical approximations and simulations. We
   observe that the proposed model significantly improves performance of
   the IEEE 802.15.6 CSMA/CA by resolving hidden node problems.},

Title = {Design and performance analysis of prime number based backoff counter
   adjustment (PBCA) algorithm for wireless body area networks},
Journal = {TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 23},
Abstract = {Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) are critical in medical emergency
   services within the Internet of Things (IoT). Ensuring efficient channel
   utilization while avoiding collisions and optimizing route allocation is
   a significant research focus in this field. However, the existing
   CSMA/CA methods need help updating the contention window and achieving
   fair node distribution. This paper proposes a novel Prime number-based
   Backoff Counter Adjustment (PBCA) strategy to address this issue. The
   PBCA algorithm dynamically adjusts the contention window based on the
   success counter and the prime backoff stages (BS). A mathematical
   analysis of the proposed PBCA algorithm uses Discrete-Time Markov Chains
   to study its impact on saturated throughput and collision probability.
   The proposed algorithm simulation experiments demonstrate the
   superiority of the PBCA algorithm over existing approaches. The proposed
   strategy significantly enhances throughput, reduces packet loss and
   delay, and ensures the reliability of the WBAN network. Compared to
   existing algorithms, the PBCA algorithm optimizes 48.1\% in throughput,
   39.47\% in packet loss, 45.11\% in delay, and 78.62\% in reliability.
   These results outstand the performance of the existing algorithms. This
   advancement holds promise for enhancing performance and reliability in
   medical emergency services within IoT applications. The future extension
   of this work involves integrating reinforcement learning techniques to
   assess network status accurately, enabling adaptive and intelligent
   channel allocation in wireless body area networks.},

Abstract = {Since the IPv6 Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) can be utilized
   for information dissemination, this network gains significant attention
   in recent years. Proxy mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is standard for mobility
   control based on network at entire IP wireless applications. But,
   group-based body area networks cannot respond effectively. A new
   improved group flexibility system decrease the number of control
   messages contain router requests as well as advertising messages when
   compared to the group-based PMIPv6 protocol, in order to minimize delay
   and signaling costs. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard for low-power personal
   area networks (6LoWPAN) complies through IPv6-compliant MAC and physical
   layers. If the default parameters, excessive collisions, packet loss,
   and great latency occur arbitrarily in high traffic by default MAC
   parameters while using a great number of 6LoWPAN nodes. The implemented
   Whale optimization algorithm is based on artificial neural network
   optimization, genetic algorithm or particle swarm optimization to choose
   and authenticate MAC parameters. This manuscript proposes a novel
   intelligent method for choosing optimally configured MAC 6LoWPAN layer
   set parameters. Results of simulations based on the metrics such as
   Average delay time (ADT), Average signaling cost, Delivery ratio, Energy
   consumption, Latency, Network Life time (Nlt), Packet Overhead (PO),

Abstract = {Critical medical conditions, such as chemotherapy, post-surgery and
   premature birth, require continuous health monitoring. In general, it is
   done manually in an intensive care unit (ICU) using wired physiological
   medical devices (PMD) placed near the patient bed by the nursing staff.
   With the advent of wireless body area networks (WBAN), the vital
   parameters monitoring task can be automated, and the vital data of the
   critical patients can be monitored remotely by the professionals for
   timely measures in emergency conditions. The WBAN is formed using
   three-tier architecture. Tier-1 has ZigBee enabled sensors and personal
   area network coordinator to assimilate the data sent by the sensor
   nodes. Tier-2 has Wi-Fi as a bridge to transfer the vital data to the
   hospital information system located in tier -3. As both the networking
   techniques (ZigBee and Wi-Fi) use the same 2.4 Citlz Industrial,
   Scientific, and Medical (ISM) band, which leads to the coexistence
   issue. This paper deals with the interference analysis and modeling of
   MAC protocols for the coexistence of ZigBee and Wi-li for a hospital
   centered wireless body area network (HCWBAN). Various network simulation
   models arc executed for their Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) mode and
   total number of nodes in the model. An exhaustive investigation is done
   to recognize the aspects affecting the coexistence of ZigBee and Wi-Fi.
   In the end, results are compared with similar studies and found to be
   better.},

Abstract = {Among the wireless body area network (WBAN) scarce resources, energy
   resource is an essential resource on which most of the WBAN biomedical
   devices activities depend upon. The biomedical devices are usually
   battery-powered and if they fail to operate as required because of
   battery power drain, the WBAN system would become unreliable, and this
   could lead to life-threatening situations. Consequently, it would be
   advantage and logical to minimize energy consumption and energy wastage
   issues to achieve an energy-efficient WBAN system. Following this, we
   proposed a coordinated superframe duty cycle hybrid MAC (SDC-HYMAC)
   protocol to enhance energy efficiency and to prolong the biomedical
   devices' lifetime. To improve the energy efficiency of the WBAN system,
   we introduced different energy resource management strategies including
   the design of a priority-based slot-allocation scheme to minimize
   timeslot and energy wastage. Also, we proposed a coordinated superframe
   duty cycle (SDC) scheme to accurately select an appropriate superframe
   order (SO) based on the traffic information and the priority level of
   the biomedical devices to save energy and prolong the devices' lifetime.
   We compared the SDC-HYMAC protocol with other related protocols like
   MG-HYMAC, HyMAC, and CPMAC for the sake of validation, and is simulated
   in MATLAB. The outcome of the simulation results revealed that the
   SDC-HYMAC protocol performed better than the existing protocols using
   performance metrics like convergence speed, energy efficiency, delay,
   packet drop ratio, and devices' lifetime.},

Abstract = {Wireless sensor networks and, particularly wireless body area networks
   (WBANs) are the key building blocks of upcoming generation networks.
   Modern health care system is one of the most popular WBAN application
   and a hot area of research in subject to present work. In recent years,
   research has focused on channel modeling, energy conservation and design
   of efficient medium access control (MAC) schemes. Less attention has
   been paid to the path-loss performance analysis. In this work, we
   propose LAEEBA (Link-aware and Energy Efficient scheme for Body Area
   Networks) which is a reliable, path-loss efficient and high throughput
   routing protocol for WBANs. The characteristics of single-hop and
   multi-hop communication schemes have been utilized to reduce path-loss
   effects and increase network lifetime. A cost function is proposed to
   select the forwarder node on the basis of has high residual energy and
   minimum distance to sink. Residual energy parameter balances the energy
   consumption among the sensor nodes while distance parameter ensures
   successful packet delivery to sink. Simulation results show that LAEEBA
   protocol maximizes the network stability period and nodes stay alive for
   longer time; which contributes to sufficient decrease in the path-losses
   occurring in the links connecting sensors on a human body and hence
   transferring of data with much less losses. Results show better
   performance of our proposed protocol as compared to its given variants.},

Abstract = {The Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA)
   procedure of IEEE 802.15.6 Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols for the
   Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) use an Alternative Binary Exponential
   Backoff (ABEB) procedure. The backoff algorithm plays an important role
   to avoid collision in wireless networks. The Binary Exponential Backoff
   (BEB) algorithm used in different standards does not obtain the optimum
   performance due to enormous Contention Window (CW) gaps induced from
   packet collisions. Therefore, The IEEE 802.15.6 CSMA/CA has developed
   the ABEB procedure to avoid the large CW gaps upon each collision.
   However, the ABEB algorithm may lead to a high collision rate (as the CW
   size is incremented on every alternative collision) and poor utilization
   of the channel due to the gap between the subsequent CW. To minimize the
   gap between subsequent CW sizes, we adopted the Prioritized Fibonacci
   Backoff (PFB) procedure. This procedure leads to a smooth and gradual
   increase in the CW size, after each collision, which eventually
   decreases the waiting time, and the contending node can access the
   channel promptly with little delay; while ABEB leads to irregular and
   fluctuated CW values, which eventually increase collision and waiting
   time before a re-transmission attempt. We analytically approach this
   problem by employing a Markov chain to design the PFB scheme for the
   CSMA/CA procedure of the IEEE 80.15.6 standard. The performance of the
   PFB algorithm is compared against the ABEB function of WBAN CSMA/CA. The
   results show that the PFB procedure adopted for IEEE 802.15.6 CSMA/CA
   outperforms the ABEB procedure.},

Abstract = {The body movement and change in posture exhibit high mobility in sensor
   nodes which causes shadowing in the Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN).
   Due to this, the connectivity between the nodes in WBAN is affected
   which further causes failure in data delivery. This article presents a
   MAC protocol in WBAN to deal with the problem of data delivery due to
   body movement and postural mobility. It uses an Improved Initial
   Centroid K-means clustering technique for classification of various
   human body postures followed by back propagation neural network as a
   classifier to recognize human body posture. This article proposes a
   posture aware dynamic data delivery (PA-DDD) protocol to deliver data
   dynamically. The PA-DDD protocol can be used under varying speed walking
   scenario. The simulation results show that it prolongs the network
   lifetime and is energy efficient.},

Abstract = {Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) have the potential for extensive use
   in health care monitoring. To provide optimum network utilization, it is
   important to efficiently schedule multiple co-existing WBANs which could
   possibly suffer from high degree of interference. A graceful coexistence
   can be feasible by appropriately scheduling transmissions from different
   WBANs. In this paper, we use a recent standard of IEEE 802.15.6 (TG6),
   which has been finalized in May 2012, to address the problems of intra
   and inter-WBAN interference. This standard offers several advantages for
   medical applications as compared to IEEE 802.15.4 which has been
   previously adopted for numerous healthcare applications. In this paper,
   we propose a QoS based MAC scheduling approach to avoid inter-WBAN
   interference and introduce a fuzzy inference engine for intra-WBAN
   scheduling so as to avoid interference within WBANs.},

Abstract = {Various simulation studies for wireless body area networks (WBANs) based
   on the IEEE 802.15.6 standard have recently been carried out. However,
   most of these studies have applied a simplified model without using any
   major components specific to IEEE 802.15.6, such as connection-oriented
   link allocations, inter-WBAN interference mitigation, or a two-hop star
   topology extension. Thus, such deficiencies can lead to an inaccurate
   performance analysis. To solve these problems, in this study, we
   conducted a comprehensive review of the major components of the IEEE
   802.15.6 standard and herein present modeling strategies for
   implementing IEEE 802.15.6 MAC on an NS-3 simulator. In addition, we
   configured realistic network scenarios for a performance evaluation in
   terms of throughput, average delay, and power consumption. The
   simulation results prove that our simulation system provides acceptable
   levels of performance for various types of medical applications, and can
   support the latest research topics regarding the dynamic resource
   allocation, inter-WBAN interference mitigation, and intra-WBAN routing.},

Abstract = {An energy efficiency optimization model for the IEEE 802.15.6 standard
   based wireless body area network is described in this paper. Cross-layer
   approach has been used here by focusing on physical (PHY) and medium
   access control (MAC) layers taking into account relevant characteristics
   therein. Studied PHY is based on impulse radio ultra wideband (IR-UWB)
   signaling with mandatory on-off keying modulation and non-coherent
   energy detection receiver. The analyzed MAC protocol is slotted Aloha
   which is used in the contention based mode of the IEEE 802.15.6 std.
   using IR-UWB PHY. The proposed model can be used to compare the energy
   efficiency of uncoded and coded transmissions using different
   Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem code rates. The model enables joint code rate
   and packet length optimization in AWGN channel when using the path loss
   model for hospital scenario, defined by the IEEE P802.15 working group.
   Results clearly show the most energy efficient code rate and packet
   length as a function of distance.},

Abstract = {Co-channel interference occurs in coexisting Wireless Body Area Networks
   (WBANs) and has an impact on the capacity allocation of the networks.
   The proposed Two Stage Capacity Allocation (TSCA) mitigates interference
   and maximizes the capacity of poor channel quality WBANs with high
   priority data. It uses traditional inter-ference mitigation schemes such
   as transmission power level control, channel switching and relay-aided
   trans-mission in each instant of pause time. The proposed work
   introduces a metric called Emergency Residual Index (ER-Index) and
   chooses any one of the mitigation schemes. The ER Index value provides a
   trade-off between residual energy, emergency factor and channel metrics.
   Further, TSCA executes a two-stage capacity allocation method. The TSCA
   scheme is a combination of the Nash bargaining solution and the Min-Max
   algorithm. The mitigated interference is 45\% compared to Dynamic link
   quality-based Sub Channel Allocation (DSCA) and 60\% compared to Traffic
   Aware Medium Access Control (TA-MAC). The average energy consumption is
   decreased up to 37.82\% compared to TA-MAC and 25.59\% compared to the
   DSCA algorithm.},

Title = {Traffic Priority Based Channel Assignment Technique for Critical Data
   Transmission in Wireless Body Area Network},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {42},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In recent days, intelligent biomedical sensors and wearable devices are
   changing the healthcare industry by providing various heterogeneous
   vital signs of patients to the hospitals, caregivers, and clinicals.
   This collective form of monitoring sensor devices forms a very
   short-range Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) and plays a key role in
   the data gathering process. If any sensor node in the network detects
   abnormal values that should be transmitted promptly via wireless medium
   with less delay. A single medium allows one-way delivery of a data
   packet, and it may not be sufficient to satisfy the high volume of
   communication demand between the sensor nodes in the network. In the
   same way, the packet prioritization does not guarantee the packet will
   get there on time and sometime it may cause priority conflicts among the
   nodes. It is only mean that the flow of delivery service handles that
   critical data packet before handling other data packets. However,
   unexploited time slots and bandwidth wastage will occur due to
   inefficient backoff management and collisions. To minimize the
   aforementioned issues, various backoff procedures, adaptive slot
   allocation mechanisms, priority-based medium access control protocols
   have been developed but suffer limitations in the context of providing
   priority-based channel access with less backoff conflicts and dedicated
   allocation of time slots for critical nodes in all cases. Based on these
   deliberations, a more effective Traffic Priority-based Channel Access
   Technique (TP-CAT) is proposed using IEEE 802.15.6 in order to minimize
   the transmission delay of critical data packet and solve conflicts among
   other priority nodes during the backoff phases. Firstly, a Low Threshold
   Criticality-based Adaptive Time slot Allocation algorithm (LT-CATA) is
   presented to decrease the priority slot conflicts between the low
   threshold data traffic from the same and different type of user
   prioritynodes. Secondly, a High Threshold Criticality-based Adaptive
   Time slot Allocation algorithm (HT-CATA) is developed to reduce the
   priority slot conflicts between the high threshold data traffic from the
   same and different types of user prioritynodes. Additionally, a novel
   Random Overlapping Backoff value Avoidance (ROBA) technique is
   introduced to eliminate the overlapping issue during the selection of
   random backoff value among the sensor nodes. Since, the proposed
   technique greatly reduced the channel access delay and transmissiondelay
   of critical data packet as well as other types of priority data packet.
   The Simulation results are verified in the CASTALIA 3.2 framework using
   omnet++ network simulater to relatively evaluate the performance metrics
   of the TP-CAT technique with state-of-the-art protocols. From the
   analysis of the results, it is evident that the TP-CAT technique
   provides better performance in terms of delay, energy consumption, and
   throughput in healthcare monitoring environments.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes the preliminary investigation of rate adaptive error
   correction coding applied to MAC layer of UWB Body Area Network (WBAN).
   As the reliability of system is very important in patient-critical
   monitoring, the issue can be improved by appending Error Correction Code
   (ECC) to communication message. However, such an effort can cause the
   packet overhead, latency, and more power consumption. To mitigate these
   disadvantages, the rate adaptive of ECC is proposed. The Reed-Solomon
   (RS) code designed in GF256 has been employed in this study. It fits
   well the maximum MAC length which is 255 bytes. In our investigation,
   several MIT-BIH Arrhythmia databases are chosen as input data to
   represent the patient monitoring. Considering the physical layer of WBAN
   standard, Ultra Wideband offers an advantage in term of bandwidth
   availability. Fading channel is employed to examine code's performance.
   The code rate and capability of error correction performance is measured
   in both Bit Error Rate (BER) and Block Error Rate (BLER).},

   Communications},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Intra-body Communication (IBC) is a communication method using the human
   body as a communication medium, in which body-attached devices exchange
   electro-magnetic (EM) wave signals with each other. The fact that our
   human body consists of water and electrolytes allows such communication
   methods to be possible. Such a communication technology can be used to
   design novel body area networks that are secure and resilient towards
   external radio interference. While being an attractive technology for
   enabling new applications for human body-centered ubiquitous
   applications, network protocols for IBC systems is yet under-explored.
   The IEEE 802.15.6 standards present physical and medium access control
   (MAC) layer protocols for IBC, but, due to many simplifications, we find
   that its MAC protocol is limited in providing an environment to enable
   high data rate applications. This work, based on empirical EM wave
   propagation measurements made for the human body communication channel,
   presents IB-MAC, a centralized Time-division multiple access (TDMA)
   protocol that takes in consideration the transmission latency the body
   channel induces. Our results, in which we use an event-based simulator
   to compare the performance of IB-MAC with two different IEEE 802.15.6
   standard-compliant MAC protocols and a state-of-the art TDMA-based MAC
   protocol for IBC, suggest that IB-MAC is suitable for supporting high
   data rate applications with comparable radio duty cycle and latency
   performance.},

   which performance analysis for media access layer (MAC) protocol is

   calculate access probability and throughput of system. However, previous
   works usually assumed that channel is ideal and with both saturation and
   non-saturation conditions effect of remained packets, which were
   transmitted unsuccessfully due to collision or busy channel, was not
   considered adequately. The target of this paper is to evaluate system
   performance more accurately and flexibly, considering channel is

   statistical mathematics instead of saturation and non-saturation
   condition and then to optimize parameters to achieve higher performance.},

Abstract = {Media access control (MAC) plays a pivotal role in ensuring proper
   operation in wireless body area networks (WBANs). However, current
   solutions still cannot satisfy the stringent requirements of low power
   and low delay for emergency data reporting. In this paper, we propose an
   energy-efficient and emergency-aware MAC (EEEA-MAC) protocol for meeting
   such a rigorous demand. First, we design a node-different channel access
   scheme, in which source nodes use the CSMA/CA pattern while relay nodes
   adopt the hybrid CSMA/CA-TDMA pattern. Second, we devise an
   emergency-first time-slot allocation scheme, in which channel sensing is
   performed and the emergency data is handled by relay nodes according to
   different cases. EEEA-MAC has two striking features. One is that, source
   nodes adopt the CSMA/CA scheme instead of the conventional CSMA/CA-TDMA
   scheme, ensuring the requirement because there are almost no collisions
   and no confirmation messages in this scheme. The other is that, relay
   nodes use a sensing-based emergency data handling mechanism instead of
   the traditional empty-slot occupying mechanism, further guaranteeing the
   requirement owing to the immediate handling of emergency data and the
   short time of channel sensing. Extensive simulations demonstrate the
   advantages of EEEA-MAC in terms of energy dissipation and latency.},

Abstract = {Interest and need for Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) have
   significantly increased recently. WBAN consists of miniaturized sensors
   designed to collect and transmit data through wireless network, enabling
   medical specialists to monitor patients during their normal daily life
   and providing real time opinions for medical diagnosis. Many wireless
   technologies have proved themselves in WBAN applications, while others
   are still under investigations. The choice of the technology to adopt
   may depend on the disease to monitor and the performance requirements,
   i.e. reliability, latency and data rate. In addition, the suitable
   sensor is essential when seeking to extract the data related to a
   medical measure. This paper aims at surveying the wireless technologies
   used in WBAN systems. In addition to a detailed survey on the existing
   technologies, the use of the emerging Low Power Wide Area Network
   (LPWAN) technologies, and the future 5G, B5G and 6G is investigated,
   where the suitability of these technologies to WBAN applications is
   studied from several perspectives. Furthermore, medical applications of
   WBAN are discussed by presenting their methodologies, the adopted
   wireless technologies and the used sensors. Given that each medical
   application requires the appropriate sensor to extract the data, we
   highlight a wide range of the sensors used in the market for medical
   systems. Recent and future challenges in WBAN systems are given related
   to the power consumption, the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT)
   technologies in WBAN and others.},

Title = {A Study on Coexistence Capability Evaluations of the Enhanced Channel
   Hopping Mechanism in WBANs},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {As an important coexistence technology, channel hopping can reduce the
   interference among Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs). However, it
   simultaneously brings some issues, such as energy waste, long latency
   and communication interruptions, etc. In this paper, we propose an
   enhanced channel hopping mechanism that allows multiple WBANs coexisted
   in the same channel. In order to evaluate the coexistence performance,
   some critical metrics are designed to reflect the possibility of channel
   conflict. Furthermore, by taking the queuing and non-queuing behaviors
   into consideration, we present a set of analysis approaches to evaluate
   the coexistence capability. On the one hand, we present both
   service-dependent and service-independent analysis models to estimate
   the number of coexisting WBANs. On the other hand, based on the uniform
   distribution assumption and the additive property of Possion-stream, we
   put forward two approximate methods to compute the number of occupied
   channels. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our estimation
   approaches can provide an effective solution for coexistence capability
   estimation. Moreover, the enhanced channel hopping mechanism can
   significantly improve the coexistence capability and support a larger
   arrival rate of WBANs.},

Abstract = {Energy efficiency is an important quality-of-service requirement that
   needs to be considered when designing an efficient MAC protocol for a
   WBAN system due to the limited power resources of biomedical sensor
   devices. To address this, an energy-aware multi-group hybrid MAC
   (MG-HYMAC) protocol is proposed in this work to improve energy
   efficiency as well as the lifetime of the biomedical sensor devices in a
   personalized healthcare system. The proposed protocol combines both the
   advantages of the CSMA/CA and the TDMA schemes to enable the biomedical
   sensors to efficiently contend for transmission opportunities and to
   allow them to efficiently transmit health data. The MG-HYMAC protocol is
   combined with a transmission scheduling technique to duty cycle the
   operations of the biomedical devices with less critical data to
   determine when and how the biomedical sensor devices will transmit their
   health data packets in order to reduce collisions to save energy and
   prolong the battery lifetime of the biomedical sensor devices so as to
   improve the overall network lifetime. Also, a stochastic probability
   model and a heuristic-based power control scheme are developed to solve
   time allocation and power control problems to improve energy efficiency
   and the biomedical sensor devices lifetime. To validate the MG-HYMAC
   protocol, it was compared with other related protocols (including HyMAC
   and CPMAC) and simulated in MATLAB. The simulation results proved that
   the proposed MG-HYMAC protocol outperformed the existing MAC protocols
   using standard metrics like energy efficiency, biomedical sensor devices
   lifetime, and convergence speed.},

Abstract = {Wireless body area networks (WBANs) is a technology that offers better
   methods for real-time patient health monitoring. By the year 2025,
   industry and academia estimate up to 3 billion wearable sensors placed
   in different WBANs, gathering health data from patients and sending them
   to medical servers. However, data transmission from WBANs to those
   medical servers is still a challenging task. In particular, wireless
   transmission can result in high latency and low throughput due to
   interference, which causes risks to healthcare patients. The existing
   solutions address wireless transmission interference inside the same
   WBAN or the interference that one WBAN can make on another. These
   solutions rarely cope with both interferences from a medical application
   perspective. In this article, we detail PDAC, a medical
   application-aware MAC-layer P rotocol for D ynamic Channel A lloC ation.
   At a glance, PDAC takes advantage of the existence of multiple base
   stations in the most common wireless network environments. In this
   sense, it orchestrates the cooperation among base stations, even in
   dense medical-hospital environments, by properly allocating co-located
   wireless body area networks. PDAC relies on a greedy solution for a
   graph coloring problem to reduce interferences and enhance data
   communication. According to evaluations, we observe an average increase
   of 30\% on the system throughput and an average reduction of 40\% in the
   system latency when compared to a baseline solution.},

Title = {Design, implementation and analysis of cognitive radio enabled
   intelligent WBAN gateway for cost-efficient remote health monitoring},
Journal = {PHYSICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {35},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In this paper, we design and implement an intelligent gateway for
   Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) that seeks opportunistic access of
   licensed Primary User (PU) channels using Cognitive Radio (CR) to
   facilitate spectral-efficient, cost-efficient and reliable Non-Real Time
   (NRT) backhaul transmission of WBAN data for ubiquitous healthcare
   monitoring. The controller is termed herein as BodyCog-BNC. We develop
   and implement a cross-layer based modified protocol stack at the
   BodyCog-BNC, comprising of BodyCog-BNC Management Entity (BME) and
   BodyCog-BNC CR Medium Access Control (BCR-MAC) units, to exploit cross
   layer message passing to support the novel idea of spectrum agility. A
   spectral agile BodyCog-BNC is capable of intelligently switching to
   conventional licensed Wide-Area Access Network (WAN) technology in case
   of lack of proper PU channels or occurrence of successive handoffs in
   multiple PU channels. Furthermore, the protocol stack facilitates
   session management and energy-efficient backhaul CR transmission over a
   PU channel employing a proposed Inter-Sensing Time Optimization (ISTO)
   algorithm. ISTO leverages on convex optimization to select the optimum
   inter-sensing time for a PU channel to maximize the energy-efficiency
   within a PU interference constraint under sensing uncertainties. Closed
   form analytical expressions are also derived to estimate the average
   consumed energy, switching probability, switching time and the
   cost-efficiency of BodyCog-BNC. Exhaustive performance analysis shows
   that the BodyCog-BNC (WBAN gateway), provides a cost-efficient solution
   for different healthcare applications under varied operating conditions
   and CR cost regimes. Finally, through a prototype implementation and
   proof of concept we validate the ability of BodyCog-BNC in enabling NRT
   remote healthcare monitoring. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Wireless body area networks (WBANs) contain set of wearable and/or
   implantable sensors that are located in, on, around or in immediate
   proximity to the human body. The fundamental concept of WBANs can be
   developed into future body-to-body (B2B) communication systems by
   attaining the existence of multiple co-located WBANs as well as their
   mutual coordination and communication. The huge scope of challenges and
   potential applications (i.e., sports and fitness, rescue and critical
   operations etc.) associated with B2B communication has led to many
   publications. On the other hand, a thorough characterization of B2B
   propagation channels is the foremost step whether the purpose is
   minimizing the interference from neighboring WBANs or maintaining a good
   quality communication link between adjacent WBANs. Therefore, we
   highlight different candidate applications of B2B communication systems
   and present an investigative overview of various B2B channel models.
   Moreover, several physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC)
   parameters are enlisted and discussed with regards to their impact on
   packet reception rate (PRR) performance in B2B communication systems.},

Abstract = {The rapid development of medical sensors has increased the interest in
   Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) applications where physiological data
   from the human body and its environment is gathered, monitored, and
   analyzed to take the proper measures. In WBANs, it is essential to
   design MAC protocols that ensure adequate performance and Quality of
   Service (QoS). This paper investigates Medium Access Control (MAC)
   protocols used in WBAN, and compares their performance in a high traffic
   environment with respect to different QoS and network performance
   metrics. Such scenario can be induced in case of emergency for example,
   where physiological data collected from all sensors on human body should
   be sent simultaneously to take appropriate action. This study can also
   be extended to cover collaborative WBAN systems where information from
   different bodies is sent simultaneously leading to high traffic. OPNET
   simulations are performed to compare the performance of the different
   MAC protocols under the same experimental conditions. A new MAC scheme
   aiming to enhance the delay, throughput, and energy performance of the
   system is then proposed and compared to existing protocols, to evaluate
   its performance in high traffic environment.},

Abstract = {The advancement in electronics, wireless communications and integrated
   circuits has enabled the development of small low-power sensors and
   actuators that can be placed on, in or around the human body. A wireless
   body area network (WBAN) can be effectively used to deliver the sensory
   data to a central server, where it can be monitored, stored and
   analyzed. For more than a decade, cognitive radio (CR) technology has
   been widely adopted in wireless networks, as it utilizes the available
   spectra of licensed, as well as unlicensed bands. A cognitive radio body
   area network (CRBAN) is a CR-enabled WBAN. Unlike other wireless
   networks, CRBANs have specific requirements, such as being able to
   automatically sense their environments and to utilize unused, licensed
   spectra without interfering with licensed users, but existing protocols
   cannot fulfill them. In particular, the medium access control (MAC)
   layer plays a key role in cognitive radio functions, such as channel
   sensing, resource allocation, spectrum mobility and spectrum sharing. To
   address various application-specific requirements in CRBANs, several MAC
   protocols have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we survey
   MAC protocols for CRBANs. We then compare the different MAC protocols
   with one another and discuss challenging open issues in the relevant
   research.},

Abstract = {According to emergency of wireless body area network (WBAN), the
   IEEE802.15.6 standard was established in Feb. 2012. A physical (PHY)
   layer, medium access control (MAC) layer and network layer were almost
   decided, however a payload in every packet is varied within {[}0,250]
   bytes. Since the low influence on human body and the low transmit power
   are required, the received signal to noise ratio (SNR) of coordinator
   depends on distances between sensors and the coordinator and varies in a
   larger region. Therefore, the assumption of noise free is no longer
   available. The discrete time Markov chain method (DTMC) is proposed to
   calculate the access probability of every sensor and analyze the
   performance of system with regard to packet error rate. The calculation
   method of power consumption is also proposed to correctly estimate the
   power consumption of WBANs that adopt the carrier sense multiple access
   with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) as a transmission protocol. The
   payload is optimized for every Eb/N0 in order to obtain the best energy
   efficiency. The calculation result indicates that the optimal payload
   decreases when the Eb/N0 decreases while the total data which a sensor
   should transmit to the coordinator is being fixed, whereas the optimal
   payload increases slightly in low Eb/N0 region when the total data
   increases.},

Title = {An Adaptive Backoff Mechanism for IEEE 802.15.4 Beacon-Enabled Wireless
   Body Area Networks},
Journal = {WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING},
Year = {2018},
Abstract = {Carrier sense multiple access mechanism with collision avoidance
   (CSMA/CA) in IEEE 802.15.4-based wireless body area networks (WBANs) may
   impair the transmission reliability of emergency traffic under high
   traffic loads, which may result in loss of high valued medical
   information. Majority of the recent proposals recommend an early
   retransmission of failed frame while ignoring the history of past failed
   transmissions. More importantly, these proposals do not consider the
   number of failed transmissions experienced by each sensor node, thereby
   affecting the reliability of retransmissions. In this paper, we propose
   a dynamic retransmission adaptive intelligent MAC (RAI-MAC) scheme. In
   our proposed scheme retransmission class of each sensor node is decided
   by the coordinator according to the number of failed transmissions of
   each node as observed by the coordinator during the last superframe.
   Based on the retransmission class received from the coordinator, each
   node adjusts its next backoff value. The proposed scheme increases the
   probability of successful frame retransmissions without incurring extra
   overhead. The simulation results prove that the proposed scheme based on
   its adaptive retransmission mechanism achieves higher average throughput
   and average end-to-end delay, while not compromising on energy
   efficiency as compared to the IEEE 802.15.4 and Block Acknowledgment
   (Block Ack). Moreover, our scheme appears more stable in terms of
   average throughput, end-to-end delay, and energy efficiency under
   different values of beacon order (BO) and superframe order (SO).},

Abstract = {Wireless sensor network is widely used in different IoT-enabled
   applications such as health care, underwater sensor networks, body area
   networks, and various offices. A sensor node may face operational
   difficulties due to low computing capacity. Moreover, mobility has
   become an open challenge in the healthcare wireless body area network
   that is highly affected by message loss due to topological manipulation.
   In this article, an enhanced version of the well-known algorithm MT-MAC
   is proposed, namely DT-MAC, to ensure successful message delivery. It
   considers node handover mechanism among virtual clusters to ensure
   network integrity and also uses the concept of minimum connected
   dominating set for network formation to achieve efficient energy
   utilization. It is then compared with well-known algorithms such as
   MT-MAC. The simulation results show that an increase in little latency
   of roughly 3 percent in using the proposed protocol improves the
   MT-MAC's packet delivery by 13-17 percent and the response time by
   around 15 percent. Therefore, the algorithm is best fitted for real-time
   applications where the high packet delivery and response time are
   required.},

Title = {Performance Analysis of WBAN MAC Protocol under Different Access Periods},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS},
Year = {2015},
Abstract = {The IEEE 802.15.6 is a new standard on wireless body area network (WBAN)
   for short-range, extremely low power wireless communication with high
   data rates in the vicinity of, or inside, a human body. The standard
   defines two contention-based channel access schemes: slotted ALOHA and
   carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) using
   an alternative binary exponential backoff procedure. The standard
   supports quality of service (QoS) differentiation through user
   priorities and access phases. In this study, we develop an analytical
   model for the estimation of performance metrics such as energy
   consumption, normalized throughput, and mean frame service time,
   employing a Markov chain model under nonsaturated heterogeneous traffic
   scenarios including different access phases specified in the standard
   for different user priorities and access methods. We conclude that the
   deployment of exclusive access phase (EAP) is not necessary in a typical
   WBAN using CSMA/CA because it degrades the overall system throughput,
   consumes more energy per packet, and results in higher delay for
   nonemergency nodes.},

Abstract = {Radio links in wireless body area networks (WBAN) experience highly
   time-varying attenuation because of topology instability. On the other
   hand, real-time, reliable, energy efficient and interference-aware
   communication protocol is the most important requirements of many WBAN
   applications. Since the channels quality is not stable, there is no any
   fixed optimal power level which meets all the requirements. In this
   paper, an adaptive Learning-based Power Aware (LPA) communication
   protocol is proposed that is capable of selecting the appropriate
   transmission power level based on the channel status. Since LPA is based
   on learning automata, it is a feedback based protocol in which the
   transmission power level is increased when it finds the channel is bad,
   and decreased as soon as it finds the channel is good. The performance
   of LPA is evaluated experimentally in five different postures and under
   three different data rates. The results are compared with communication
   protocols using fixed transmission powers under different scenarios with
   different data rates. The experimental results show LPA can save up to
   55\% of the energy consumed by the communication protocol using fixed
   high transmission power while the reliability of the communication is
   the same when the Medium Access Control (MAC) sublayer retransmission is
   enabled.},

Abstract = {Recently, IEEE 802.15.6 standard has been established to optimize
   low-power in-body/on-body nodes to serve a variety of medical and

   of medical and entertainment sensors in the near vicinity is a challenge
   in terms of Quality of Services (QoS) guaranteeing and interference
   mitigation. In order to improve the channel utilization by increasing
   the number of allowable transmission, enhancing overall performance, and
   enabling integration of different services, we propose to combine Direct
   Sequence-Ultra WideBand (DS-UWB) with slotted-Aloha random access. In
   this paper, we investigate the performance of the proposed spread
   slotted Aloha for IEEE 802.15.6 Standard in different processing gain
   scenarios and different channel models. Results indicate that relation
   between medical and entertainment spreading code length combined with
   the sensor's contention probability has the strongest effect on the

Abstract = {In this paper, a novel queueing analytical framework is proposed to
   evaluate the performance of IEEE 802.15.6-based carrier-sense multiple
   access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) scheduling in wireless body
   area networks with joint consideration of instantaneous delay
   constraints and body shadowing effects. Specifically, we develop an
   absorbing Markov chain to model the medium access process with error
   controls that is defined by the IEEE standard and design a random
   time-limited single vacation to describe the potential body shadowing
   interruption process. To guarantee the timeliness of received packets
   and avoid energy waste for transmitting valueless packets, an
   instantaneous delay constraint is carefully considered, which is then
   characterized by an overdeadline packet dropping process with a
   predefined waiting deadline. In our analysis, a Markovian arrival
   process is also adopted to capture the correlation of arrival traffic,
   and all other random processes are modeled by phase-type distributions,
   which make our framework more general and comprehensive. To address the
   inherent complexity of the original model, based on the transient
   queueing analysis, we develop a buffer-overflowing queueing principle to
   approximate the overdeadline packet dropping principle by solving a
   buffer length optimization problem. After that, we construct a
   multidimensional discrete-time Markov chain to analyze the stationary
   distribution through the matrix-geometric method. Performance measures,
   including the average delay, waiting time distribution, and packet
   transmission failure probability, are derived. The accuracy of our
   proposed analytical framework is validated by extensive simulations.},

Abstract = {Ad hoc and multi-hop networks will probably be a part of the fourth
   generation of wireless networks, which will integrate networks of
   several sizes and capacities with heterogeneous coverage: cellular
   networks (3G), WLAN hot spots, wireless personal area networks (WPAN)
   and wireless body area networks (WBAN). In this context. MAC protocols
   play a deciding role for a high utilization of the wireless channel. In
   this paper, several issues of the MAC layer and concepts for the
   definition of a new MAC protocol are presented. These concepts include
   synchronization, multi-user diversity, and multi-packet reception. It is
   shown that all these techniques can drastically increase the capacity of
   the MAC layer for multi-hop networks.},

Abstract = {Network life time of Wireless Body Area Network (WBANs) is essential for
   its operation. An integral part of the network life time is the energy
   efficiency of the devices and enabling their transmissions with the
   optimal choice of Physical layer (PHY) and Medium Access Control (MAC)
   parameters. Particularly, in the next generation wireless networks,
   where devices and sensors are heterogeneous and coexist in the same
   geographical area creating possible collisions and interference to each
   other, the battery power needs to be efficiently used. This paper
   consists of four complementing parts. In the first two parts, we study
   the two optimization algorithms proposed in our prior work. The first
   algorithm, Cross-Layer Optimization for Energy Efficiency (CLOEE),
   enables us to carry out a cross-layer resource allocation that addresses
   the rate and reliability trade-off in the PHY as well as the frame size
   optimization and transmission efficiency for the MAC layer. The second
   algorithm, Energy Efficiency Optimization of Channel Access
   Probabilities (EECAP), studies the case where the nodes access the
   medium in a probabilistic manner and jointly determines the optimal
   access probability and payload frame size for each node. These two
   algorithms address the problem from an optimization perspective. In the
   third part of the paper, we study the same problem from a game
   theoretical point of view. The last part of the paper is devoted to
   summarizing the challenges ahead and future research directions to
   increase the energy efficiency and network life time of WBANs.},

Abstract = {This paper deals with the positioning performance of the 3-Way ranging
   protocol (3-WR) in a wireless body area network (WBAN). The purpose is
   to propose a new cooperative algorithm to improve the number of
   estimated positions with a conditional permutation of the on-body
   anchors. To do so, we first evaluate and analyze the positioning success
   rate under a realistic mobility scenario and using two scheduling
   strategies: Broadcast single node localization (P2P-B) and aggregated
   and broadcast (A\&B)) with a medium access control (MAC) layer based on
   time division multiple access (TDMA). The 3-WR estimates the distance
   between two nodes placed on the body with the transmission of three
   packets. The wireless transmission is based on impulse radio ultra
   wideband (IR-UWB). However, these transactions can be lost through the
   WBAN channel leading into a ``bad positioning service.{''} We consider a
   physical layer based on IR-UWB with three different channels: (1) an
   empirical theoretical model based on the on-body CM3 path loss channel
   (Anechoic chamber), (2) a simulated channel calculated by ray-tracing
   with the PyLayers simulator, and (3) an experimental channel model
   obtained by measurements. Our results show that the channel affects the
   positioning success rate that decreases as a function of the sensitivity
   threshold at the receiver. This can be solved with long and short term
   analysis for the choice of virtual anchors to increase the positioning
   performance.},

Abstract = {Wireless Body Area networks (WBANs) aim at supporting a variety of

   it is very challenging to design MAC protocols for WBANs to offer
   scheduling flexibility, high reliability, energy efficiency and others

   overflow-aware adaptive polling and node-initiated link adaptation, for
   Baseline MAC to improve the packet reception ratio (PRR) in the critical
   scenarios with high traffic demand and deep fading. The simulation
   results through extensive simulations in Castalia show that compared
   with Baseline MAC and dynamic interleaving, the combined enhancement
   scheme can significantly improve PRR under different traffic profiles
   and channel conditions in WBANs.},

Abstract = {Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) consists of health and environmental
   sensing nodes and a dedicated hub. The hub has more processing power and
   capabilities than the sensor nodes. It collects sensing data and
   forwards them to corresponding destinations for further processing and
   actions. In case of emergencies, the hub delivers the received data to
   the emergency department to take quick action. The end-to-end link
   between the sensor node and the emergency department mainly depends on
   the sensor node's bottleneck link and the hub. WBAN nodes communicate
   with the hub by accessing the physical communication channel in a
   randomly distributed fashion. Random channel access may cause
   retransmission of corrupted frames due to frame collisions. This causes
   performance degradation of the deployed WBAN. The IEEE 802.15.6 standard
   specified eight different user priorities for different traffic types.
   Among these priorities, priority seven is dedicated to reporting
   emergency and medical implant events. If several nodes report at this
   priority, this causes lower priority nodes to starve. In this work, we
   allow nodes to switch from lower priorities to priority seven in
   emergencies. We conducted several experiments to study the effects of
   priority seven on other nodes in normal operations and emergencies. The
   study results showed that the packet delivery rate is severely affected
   when some nodes switch from normal user priority to priority seven. More
   studies and investigations need to be conducted to determine the optimum
   operation of WBAN, especially in the case of an emergency.},

Abstract = {Sensor networks are being researched and deployed in wide range of
   applications in healthcare. A number of tiny wireless sensors
   strategically placed on or in the human body, create a wireless body
   area network (WBAN) that can monitor various vital signs and provide
   real-time feedback to the medical personnel. In this paper we present
   the architecture of an ambulatory e-health system including a
   cluster-tree structured WBAN. In this WBAN, to achieve synchronization,
   the BAN coordinator and cluster heads (CHs) send beacon frames
   periodically. It is necessary to schedule the different beacon frames to
   avoid beacon collisions. We propose a Distributed Access Scheme (DAS) to
   solve the beacon collision problem. In Distributed Access Scheme, the
   CHs select their own contention-free time slot (CFTS) of the beacon-only
   period for sending its beacon frame to nodes in its cluster.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we study the performance of two cross-layer optimized
   dynamic routing techniques for radio interference mitigation across
   multiple coexisting wireless body area networks (BANs), based on
   real-life measurements. At the network layer, the best route is selected
   according to channel state information from the physical layer,
   associated with low duty cycle TDMA at the MAC layer. The routing
   techniques (i.e., shortest path routing (SPR), and novel cooperative
   multipath routing (CMR) incorporating 3-branch selection combining)
   perform real-time and reliable data transfer across BANs operating near
   the 2.4 GHz ISM band. An open-access experimental dataset of `everyday'
   mixed-activities is used for analyzing the proposed cross-layer
   optimization. We show that CMR gains up to 14 dB improvement with 8.3\%
   TDMA duty cycle, and even 10 dB improvement with 0.2\% TDMA duty cycle
   over SPR, at 10\% outage probability at a realistic
   signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Acceptable packet
   delivery ratios (PDR) and spectral efficiencies are obtained from SPR
   and CMR with reasonably sensitive receivers across a range of TDMA low
   duty cycles, with up to 9 dB improvement of CMR over SPR at 90\% PDR.

Title = {Statistical method for performance analysis of WBAN in time-saturation},
Journal = {EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING},
Year = {2014},
Month = {DEC 11},
Abstract = {Performance analysis of carrier sense multiple access with collision
   avoidance (CSMA/CA) scheme based on IEEE 802.15.6 standard has been
   discussed in many literatures. In previous works on IEEE 802.15.6 and
   another standards, the performance was analyzed by using access
   probability in one slot duration and the Markov chain model was proposed
   to calculate the access probability in both saturation and
   non-saturation models. However, for both saturation and non-saturation
   models, the access probability or the packet arrival rate was assumed to
   be fixed and the effect of remained packets that was transmitted
   unsuccessfully due to busy channel or collision was not considered. In
   this paper, in order to evaluate the system performance more accurately,
   the effect of the remained packet is taken into account and a
   statistical method is proposed to calculate the successful probability
   of wireless body area networks (WBANs). Moreover, a time-saturation
   model is defined as a system model in which the system performance is
   changed following the operating time, and then, the change between three
   models, i.e., saturation, non-saturation, and time-saturation models, is
   analyzed. The calculation result indicates that the proposal method can
   achieve the same performance as the Markov chain method in both
   saturation and non-saturation models. However, in the time-saturation
   model, the proposal statistical method is more accurate.},

Title = {Edge Intelligent Agent Assisted Hybrid Hierarchical Blockchain for
   continuous healthcare monitoring \& recommendation system in 5G WBAN-IoT},
Journal = {COMPUTER NETWORKS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {200},
Month = {DEC 9},
Abstract = {Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is an emerging technology that faces
   many challenges for monitoring patient health state information and
   early diagnosis of any disease (e.g. COVID-19). In addition, WBAN has
   many issues such as high energy consumption, overhead and latency due to
   the scarcity in resources, for that we bring edge assisted 5G
   environment in WBAN. The patient information is sensitive and easily
   traced by the attackers due to insecurity, for that, we proposed the
   EiA-H2B model (Edge intelligent Agent Hybrid Hierarchical Blockchain)
   which includes five phases. Firstly we proposed Biological PUF based
   sensor authentication, which is a strong credential that provides high
   security. All the sensors are authenticated by the virtual authenticator
   that is deployed by a blockchain ledger. Due to the mobility of WBAN, we
   focused on handover that is done by Bi-Partite One to N matching theory.
   Secondly, we proposed high voting based virtual clustering, in this
   phase high voting sensor is elected as a super node and that is used to
   create a virtual cluster. Thirdly, we proposed duty cycle MAC scheduling
   protocol is used to predict the original state of the sensors which is
   done by Attention Matrix based Gated Recurrent Unit (AM-GRU), and then
   the timeslots are allocated for avoiding packet loss and retransmission.
   Fourth, we perform relay selection and routing that is done by Global
   Optimization based Artificial Electric Field Algorithm (AEFA). And
   finally, we predict emergency data and generate an alert in EiA using
   Human Learning aided State Action Reward State Action (SARSA) algorithm
   that finds the current state and predicts the corresponding action.
   Based on that current state information SARSA provides an efficient
   recommendation to the patients. Experiments are conducted by OMNeT ++
   network simulator and evaluate the performance of the proposed EiA-H2B
   model in terms of energy consumption, success rate, network throughput,
   end to end delay, packet loss rate, authentication time and processing
   time.},

Abstract = {Emergency nodes, i.e, nodes with priority 7 as per 802.15.6 standard
   play a very important role in facilitating the immediate transfer of
   information during life threatening situations. These nodes should relay
   critical information with utmost reliability and in the shortest
   possible time. IEEE 802.15.6 provides the necessary functionality to
   these nodes by adapting the contention window sizes as well as the time
   duration over which it can transmit in a superframe. Although these
   methods solve problems when emergency nodes are few in number,
   simultaneous occurrence of emergency events in multiple nodes can create
   a situation where frames may not be transmitted within the stipulated
   response time or may be lost due to repeated collisions. This paper
   proposes two techniques using polling that can overcome such
   eventualities for emergency nodes. We evaluate the performance of the
   proposed schemes via analysis and simulation.},

Abstract = {In the context of radiolocation in Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs),
   nodes positions can be estimated through time-based ranging algorithms.
   For instance, the distance separating a couple of nodes can be estimated
   accurately by measuring the Round Trip Time of Flight of an Impulse
   Radio Ultra Wideband (IR-UWB) link. This measure usually relies on two
   or three messages transactions. Such exchanges take time and a rapid
   mobility of the nodes can reduce the ranging accuracy and consequently
   impact nodes localization process. In this paper, we quantify this
   localization error by confronting two broadcast-based optimized
   implementations of the three-way ranging algorithm with real mobility
   traces, acquired through a motion capture system. We then evaluate, in
   the same scenarios, the impact of the MAC-level scheduling of the
   packets within a TDMA frame localization accuracy. The results, obtained
   with the WSNet simulator, show that MAC scheduling can be utilized to
   mitigate the effect of nodes mobility.},

Abstract = {Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) consists of health and environmental
   sensing devices and a dedicated hub node. The hub node, which has more
   processing power and capabilities, collects and forwards sensed data
   from the sensing devices to a backend server for further processing and
   actions. Sensing devices use the CSMA/CA mechanism to communicate with
   the hub. This access mechanism may cause frame retransmission of
   corrupted frames due to collisions resulting in performance degradation.
   The IEEE 802.15.6 standard specifies seven different user priorities for
   different traffic types. Nodes with higher user priorities have a small
   channel contention window to access the channel more frequently, causing
   nodes with lower user priorities to starve. To mitigate this problem, we
   propose a mechanism based on priority switching. In the proposed
   mechanism, the nodes with a higher priority switch their contention
   window to that of the lowest user priority and then switch back to their
   original contention window after sending a single successful packet. We
   conducted intensive simulations to validate the proposed mechanism,
   which shows significant improvement in the packet delivery rate of lower
   user priority nodes and all the nodes' overall performance in terms of
   throughput, energy consumption, and inter-frame delay.},

Title = {A statistical frame based TDMA protocol for human body communication},
Journal = {BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {14},
Month = {JUL 9},
Abstract = {Background: Human body communication (HBC) using the human body as the
   transmission medium, which has been regarded as one of the most
   promising short-range communications in wireless body area networks
   (WBAN). Compared to the traditional wireless networks, two challenges
   are existed in HBC based WBAN. (1) Its sensor nodes should be energy
   saving since it is inconvenient to replace or recharge the battery on
   these sensor nodes; (2) the coordinator should be able to react
   dynamically and rapidly to the burst traffic triggered by sensing
   events. Those burst traffic conditions include vital physical signal
   (electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram etc.) monitoring, human motion
   detection (fall detection, activity monitoring, gesture recognition,
   motion sensing etc.) and so on. To cope with aforementioned challenges,
   a statistical frame based TDMA (S-TDMA) protocol with multi-constrained
   (energy, delay, transmission efficiency and emergency management)
   service is proposed in this paper.
   Methods: The scenarios where burst traffic is often triggered rapidly
   with low power consumption and low delay is handled in our proposed
   S-TDMA. A beacon frame with the contained synchronous and poll
   information is designed to reduce the possibility of collisions of
   request frames. A statistical frame which broadcasts the unified
   scheduling information is adopted to avoid packet collisions, idle
   listening and overhearing. Dynamic time slot allocation mechanism is
   presented to manage the burst traffic and reduce the active period in
   each beacon period. An emergency mechanism is proposed for vital signals
   to be transmitted. The theory analysis is proceed and the result is
   evaluated in the hardware platform.
   Results: To verify its feasibility, S-TDMA was fully implemented on our
   independentlydeveloped HBC platform where four sensor nodes and a
   coordinator are fastened on a human body. Experiment results show that
   S-TDMA costs 89.397 mJ every 20 s when the payload size is 122 bytes,
   9.51\% lower than Lightweight MAC (LMAC); the average data latency of
   S-TDMA is 6.3 ms, 7.02\% lower than Preamble-based TDMA (PB-TDMA); the
   transmission efficiency of S-TDMA is 93.67\%, 4.83\% higher than IEEE
   802.15.6 carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA)
   protocol.
   Conclusions: With respect to the challenges of HBC based WBANs, a novel
   S-TDMA protocol was proposed in this paper. Compared to the traditional
   protocols, the results demonstrate that S-TDMA successfully meets the
   delay and transmission efficiency requirements of HBC while keeping a
   low energy consumption. We also believe that our S-TDMA protocol will
   promote development of HBC in wearable applications.},

Abstract = {This paper looks into the packet size optimization for maximization of
   the energy efficiency in IEEE 802.15.6 ultrawideband (UWB) WBANs. Both

   considered for optimizing the length of the medium access control (MAC)
   frame body. The default mode is considered. Probability of packet
   detection and successful reception of physical layer header and data
   payload in both cases are derived. Path loss model with shadowing is
   considered for analysis. Results reveal an increase in optimal frame
   length and extension of hop length in case of cooperative communication
   scheme as compared to direct communication for both in-body as well as

Abstract = {Wearable sensor devices organized in a Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN)
   have been widely used in healthcare monitoring. However, energy
   efficiency and reliability are still major problems in this area. An
   efficient media access control (MAC) protocol is a promising solution.
   Traditional protocols are too generic and usually used in busy frequency
   band which are not suitable for a particular medical scenario. On the
   basis of Human Body Communication (HBC), a MAC protocol for WBAN is
   proposed in this work which can avoid interference and make non-RF
   technique available. It also helps reduce power consumption and prolong
   the network lifetime by reducing transmitting frequency and increasing
   sleep time of a WBAN node. The protocol utilizes a new ALOHA medium
   access which defines user priorities for different types of data.
   Compared with the Slotted ALOHA (S-Aloha) suggested in the IEEE 802.15.6
   standard, our method shows good performance in terms of power
   consumption when the information rate is low. In addition, a circuit
   system is designed for a medical scenario according to our new protocol.},

Abstract = {We propose the cross-layer based battery-aware time division multiple

   body-area monitoring networks in wireless healthcare applications. By
   taking into account the joint effect of electrochemical properties of

   characteristics, our proposed schemes are designed to prolong the
   battery lifespan of the wireless sensor nodes while guaranteeing the
   reliable and timely message delivery, which is critically important for
   the patient monitoring networks. In addition, we develop a Markov chain
   model to analyze the performance of our proposed schemes. Both the
   obtained analytical and simulation results show that our proposed
   schemes can significantly increase the battery lifespan of sensor nodes
   while satisfying the reliability and delay-bound quality of service
   (QoS) requirements for wireless body-area monitoring networks.
   Furthermore, the case study of the electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring
   application shows that besides meeting the delay requirements, our
   proposed schemes outperform the IEEE 802.15.4 and Bluetooth protocols in

Abstract = {Cognitive Radio (CR) is widely anticipated to address spectrum scarcity
   and interference issues in future wireless communications. As a
   promising technology, many CR related studies have sprung up to improve
   the performance of network. However, most existing works mainly focus on
   theoretical analysis and software simulation without verifying
   feasibility and performance in practical network scenarios. In this
   paper, a Hybrid Cognitive Validation Platform (HCVP) is developed to
   realize practical situations by integrating computer software and
   hardware devices. Comparing with existing FPGAbased platforms, our HCVP
   is easier to deploy and configure, by replacing FPGA with low-power
   programmable SoC chips. Moreover, with excellent performance of energy
   efficiency, HCVP can be applied to a wide scope of applications,
   especially battery-powered networks. To evaluate the performance of the
   HCVP, we implement a WBAN scenario with same frequency interference
   traffic considered. An adaptive CR MAC algorithm is adopted to minimize
   the impact of interference. Experiments close to reality are built based
   on HCVP and the results show that the introduction of CR algorithm
   significantly alleviate the negative impact of collisions caused by
   interference and improve system performance.},

Title = {An energy efficient distributed queuing random access (EE-DQRA) MAC

Abstract = {In wireless sensor networks, a significant amount of energy is consumed
   by the sensor nodes during data packet transmission and reception. An
   IEEE 802.15.4 MAC protocol is not able to completely satisfy all the
   requirements of wireless body sensor networks (BSNs) in a healthcare
   environment. Hence there is a demand for the design of a new scalable
   and energy saving MAC protocols. In this paper the challenging
   healthcare requirements are considered and based upon these
   requirements, an energy efficient distributed queuing random access
   (EE-DQRA) MAC protocol is proposed for BSN scenarios which utilizes the
   concept of distributed queuing for enhanced radio channel utilization.
   The theoretical analysis of energy efficient EE-DQRA MAC protocol is
   being carried out systematically considering the limitations of IEEE
   802.15.4 and DQ-MAC protocol. Further, EE-DQRA performance is validated
   with IEEE 802.15.4 system parameters using computer simulations. The
   effect of relative traffic load and payload length on the energy
   consumption, delay and throughput are also analyzed. The simulation
   results shows that the proposed EE-DQRA MAC with M/M/K queuing has
   better energy performance than the existing DQ-MAC and IEEE 802.15.4 MAC
   in BSN scenarios due to collisionless transmission in the data
   transmission queuing (DTQ) module while keeping the control packet
   overhead smaller in collision resolution queuing (CRQ) module. It is
   also evident that EE-DQRA requires a minimum delay in comparison to
   IEEE802.15.4 and DQ-MAC, due to overhead minimization and M/M/K queuing
   utilization in DTQ system.},

Abstract = {This letter presents a novel Sliding Window selection scheme tailored
   for optimizing the Non-Overlapping Backoff Algorithm (SW-NOBA). SW-NOBA
   is devised to tackle inter-priority collisions, while minimizing
   instances of intra-priority collisions. Its adaptive nature, dynamically
   responding to channel conditions influenced by factors such as node
   density, collision occurrences, and successful data transmissions,
   allows SW-NOBA to enhance the overall utilization of superframes.
   Evaluating SW-NOBA's efficacy involves a comparative analysis with two
   benchmarks: the Binary Exponential Backoff (BEB) and the traditional
   Non-Overlapping Backoff Algorithm (NOBA). The findings demonstrate that
   SW-NOBA significantly amplifies superframe utilization. Its introduction
   results in significant improvements in individual throughput, cumulative
   throughput, and latency when contrasted with BEB and NOBA.},

Abstract = {The IEEE 802.15.6 standard for wireless body area network (WBAN) defines
   two contention-based channel access schemes: slotted ALOHA and carrier
   sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) using an
   alternative binary exponential backoff procedure. The standard supports
   quality of service (QoS) differentiation through user priorities and
   access phases. In this study, we develop an analytical model for the
   estimation of normalized throughput and mean frame service time
   performance of the CSMA/CA protocol as described in the IEEE 802.15.6
   standard, employing a Markov chain model under non-saturated
   heterogeneous traffic scenarios. We also consider a portion of the
   access phases of the superframe and analyze its impact on the
   performance of the IEEE 802.15.6 CSMA/CA. Our analysis is validated by
   accurate computer simulations. Our results show that the IEEE 802.15.6
   CSMA/CA employing different access phases degrades the overall system
   throughput performance and results in higher delay for low priority

Abstract = {Wearable wireless medical sensors beneficially impact the healthcare
   sector, and this market is experiencing rapid growth. Globally, the
   digital health market is forecast to increase from \$80 billion in 2015
   to \$200 billion in 2020. Medical body area networks (MBANs) improve the
   mobility of patients and medical personnel during surgery, accelerate
   the patients' recovery, while facilitating the remote monitoring of
   patients suffering from chronic diseases. Currently, MBANs are being
   introduced in unlicensed frequency bands, where the risk of mutual
   interference with other electronic devices can be high. Techniques
   developed during the evolution of cognitive radio (CR) can potentially
   alleviate these problems in medical communication environments. In
   addition, these techniques can help increase the efficiency of spectrum
   usage to accommodate the rapidly growing demand for wireless MBAN
   solutions and enhance coexistence with other collocated wireless
   systems. A viable architecture of an MBAN with practical CR features is
   proposed in this work. Additionally, ultra wideband (UWB) radio for the
   implementation of CR offers many advantages to MBANs, and some features
   of this technology can be exploited for effective implementation of CR.
   Conceptual aspects associated with energy harvesting and practical
   identification of spectrum opportunities for radio frequency (RF) energy
   scavenging motivates the options taken in the development of the
   protocols. The physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layer
   aspects of the proposal are proposed in addition to their implementation
   challenges in the context of CR.},

Abstract = {In recent years, interests in the application of Wireless Body Area
   Network (WBAN) have grown considerably. A WBAN can be used to develop a
   patient monitoring system which offers flexibility and mobility to
   patients. Use of a WBAN will also allow the flexibility of setting up a
   remote monitoring system via either the internet or an intranet. For
   such medical systems it is very important that a WBAN can collect and
   transmit data reliably, and in a timely manner to the monitoring entity.
   In this paper we examine the performance of an IEEE802.15.4/Zigbee MAC
   based WBAN operating in different patient monitoring environment. We
   study the performance of a remote patient monitoring system using an

Abstract = {Blockchain is an emerging computing platform that provides recording and
   tracking facilities to substantially increase the security issues in
   healthcare systems. The evolution of wireless body area networks
   requires the continuous monitoring of the health parameters of traveling
   patients while traveling on road. The health parameter data of each
   patient are sent to the Road Side Units (RSUs) for generating the blocks
   by computing the required hash functions. A major challenge in such a
   network is to efficiently exchange the data blocks between mining RSUs
   and vehicles using a medium access protocol with a reduced number of
   collisions. The medium access problem becomes more challenging due to
   the vehicle mobility, high vehicle density and the varying nature of the
   data generated by the vehicles. In this work, a TDMA-based MAC protocol
   to meet an Adaptive Patients Data traffic for Vehicular Network
   (TAPD(VN)) is proposed. TAPD(VN) is specifically designed for patients
   in a vehicular network by considering the frequent entry and exit of
   vehicles in a mining node's coverage area. It allows mining nodes to
   adjust time slots according to the sensitive patient's data and allows
   the maximum number of patient vehicular nodes by considering their
   sensitivity to send their data in a session to compute their hash values
   accordingly. Simulation results verify that the proposed scheme
   accommodates the maximum number of high-risk patient data and improves
   bandwidth utilization by 20\%.},

Abstract = {Radio modules for future medical devices are required to minimize their
   energy consumption while maximizing the reliability of frame
   transmission. For medical devices in wireless body network, TDMA-based
   protocols can be candidates, but they have low energy efficiency in a

   continuous frame transmission (CFT) method which is a hybrid TDMA and
   random access MAC protocol with carrier sensing method. CFT controls the
   frame transmission epochs considering the effect of interference that
   changes according to the number of neighbor wireless devices. Simulation
   results show that CFT method has higher efficiency compared to
   conventional TDMA based methods in a interference environment.(1)},

   Network for Industry Use},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This research provides a study on a smart body area network (SmartBAN)
   physical layer (PHY), as an of the Internet of medical things (IoMT)
   technology, for an advanced human monitoring system in industrial use.
   The SmartBAN provides a new PHY and a medium access control (MAC) layer,
   improving its performance and providing very low-latency emergency
   information transmission with low energy consumption compared with other
   wireless body area network (WBAN) standards. On the other hand, IoMT
   applications are expected to become more advanced with smarter wearable
   devices, such as augmented reality-based human monitoring and work
   support in a factory. Therefore, it is possible to develop more advanced
   human monitoring systems for industrial use by combining the SmartBAN
   with multimedia devices. However, the SmartBAN PHY is not designed to
   transmit multimedia information such as audio and video. To address this
   issue, multilevel phase shift keying (PSK) modulation is applied to the
   SmartBAN PHY, and the symbol rate is improved by setting the roll-off
   rate appropriately to realize the system. The numerical results show
   that a sufficient link budget, receiver sensitivity and fade margin were
   obtained even when those approaches were applied to the SmartBAN PHY.
   The results indicate that these techniques are required for high-quality
   audio or video transmission, as well as vital sign data transmission, in
   a SmartBAN.},

Abstract = {IEEE 802.11 is one of the most common technologies these days. Due to
   its simplicity and easy integration in various applications its usage in
   recent years has grown exponentially {[}1]. The increasing amount of
   wireless devices and various applications such as WBAN (Wireless Body
   Area Networks), WISPs (Wireless internet service provides) have
   increased the interference in unlicensed band, which reduced the total
   system capacity. Recently the highly acclaimed version of IEEE 802.11ac
   with additional modulation capabilities was released. However, the basic
   idea and Media Access Control (MAC) layer methods were left the same.
   Therefore, there is a need for more efficient MAC layer protocol for
   usage both for currently existing IEEE 802.11n and for new IEEE 802.11ac
   standards. In this paper, we will do a case study Hybrid Carrier Sense
   Multiple Access Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) and Polling Mechanism in
   currently existing IEEE 802.11n MAC layer implementation possibilities.
   Since the main problem usually occurs on software implementation, by
   using already available Wi-Fi hardware in paper, we will consider
   various methods to bypass the limitations of already existing CSMA/CA
   protocol. Also, we will review the arising problems and currently
   available implementations of IEEE 802.11 improvements. Due to the
   dynamics of wireless environment, we also will test a Game Theory as a
   possible solution for interactions between different wireless nodes
   connected to the Access Point.},

   this distance between two nodes placed on the body can be affected by
   the human movements. Thus, we study theoretically the ranging error with
   the 3-WR, based on a perfect channel, a MAC layer based on TDMA using
   two scheduling strategies (Single node localization (P2P-B) and
   Aggregated \& Broadcast (A\&B)) and a PHY layer based on Ultra Wideband
   (IR-UWB). We demonstrate the accuracy of the model, and show that the
   distance error is highly correlated with the speed of nodes, while the
   associated mobility model has an impact on the design of MAC strategies

Abstract = {This paper presents a novel energy-efficient MAC Protocol designed
   specifically for wireless body area sensor networks (WBASN) focused
   towards pervasive healthcare applications. Wireless body area networks
   consist of wireless sensor nodes attached to the human body to monitor
   vital signs such as body temperature, activity or heart-rate. The
   network adopts a master-slave architecture, where the body-worn slave
   node periodically sends sensor readings to a central master node. Unlike
   traditional peer-to-peer wireless sensor networks, the nodes in this
   biomedical WBASN are not deployed in an ad hoc fashion. Joining a
   network is centrally managed and all communications are single-hop. To
   reduce energy consumption, all the sensor nodes are in standby or sleep
   mode until the centrally assigned time slot. Once a node has joined a
   network, there is no possibility of collision within a cluster as all
   communication is initiated by the central node and is addressed uniquely
   to a slave node. To avoid collisions with nearby transmitters, a clear
   channel assessment algorithm based on standard listen-before-transmit
   (LBT) is used. To handle time slot overlaps, the novel concept of a
   wakeup fallback time is introduced. Using single-hop communication and
   centrally controlled sleep/wakeup times leads to significant energy
   reductions for this application compared to more ``flexible{''} network
   MAC protocols such as 802.11 or Zigbee. As duty cycle is reduced, the
   overall power consumption approaches the standby power. The protocol is
   implemented in hardware as part of the Sensium (TM) system-on-chip WBASN
   ASIC, in a 0.13-mu m CMOS process.},

Abstract = {The wireless body area network requires an optimized algorithm and
   protocols for the error-free communication for sports application. The
   communication process that takes between the hub and other nodes must be
   reliable and error-free without any collision. Time division multiple
   access is a technique in which synchronization between nodes takes place
   and less reliable when compared to the other multiple access techniques.
   This paper primarily focuses on the TDMA and Polling TDMA protocols that
   could be used for the communication between the nodes. Comparison of the
   performance metrics such as packet delivery ratio, an end to end delay,
   jitter and throughput gives the network reliability between the TDMA and
   Polling TDMA. Based on the study, various MAC techniques could be used
   and the latest, TDMA could be used for error-free communication, and
   then followed by the Polling TDMA. The Reliability of 90\% was achieved
   using time division multiple access and was increased to 97\% using
   Polling TDMA. This comparison can be used to propose new algorithms to
   find the kinematic movement of the human and also reduce the energy of
   the nodes.},

Abstract = {Wireless systems that form a body-area network must be made small and
   low power without sacrificing performance. To achieve high-throughput
   communication in low-cost wireless body area networks, we propose a
   low-complexity, ``pulling{''} MAC protocol. Such a network architecture
   consists of low-complexity nodes and moderate-complexity base stations,
   which act as clients to pull data from the nodes that act as thin
   servers. This organization achieves intra-network collision-free
   multiple access as in TDMA but without expensive time synchronization.
   It also achieves high utilization of air bandwidth and adaptivity of
   CSMA protocols but without collision or complexity on the node side.
   Experimental results show that our pulling protocol achieves better good
   channel utilization of up to 52.8\% and high data throughput of up to
   432Kbps. We also tested our MAC protocol on a wireless ECG system. Our
   MAC protocol can transmit ten simultaneous streams of data at 200
   samples per second each from ten sensing devices.},

Abstract = {The IEEE 802.15.6 standard for short range communications in or around
   human body was published in February 2012. The wireless body area
   network (WBAN) standard characterizes both medium access control and
   physical layer (PHY) specifications. The medium access is disregarded
   here and the focus is on PHY definitions. There are three different PHY
   options defined in the standard. The interest in this article is in
   impulse radio ultra wideband (UWB) definitions. In it, the on-off keying
   (OOK) modulation is stated to be the one used with the mandatory mode.
   The simulation model has been implemented according to the standard's
   UWB PHY definitions. The target in this study is to define (close to) an
   optimal integration interval for an energy detector receiver and an
   energy threshold required for the OOK detection. For the energy detector
   receivers, the optimal integration interval is channel dependent and
   playing an important role in the detection performance. As the data rate
   increases, the symbol duration is shortened in impulse radio UWB.
   Depending on the channel conditions, short symbols can be vulnerable for
   inter-symbol-interference. The used channel models in the simulations
   are the IEEE 802.15.6 channel model 3 (CM 3) and another one, measured
   in a real hospital environment at the Oulu University Hospital, Oulu,
   Finland. The study is continuing our earlier work related to the
   previously published impulse radio UWB standard, the IEEE 802.15.4-2011,
   earlier known as the IEEE 802.15.4a.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses a reliability concern of the emerging wearable
   applications under dynamic and realistic conditions. We propose a new
   joint throughput and channel aware (TCA) dynamic scheduling algorithm
   for IEEE 802.15.6 standard to enhance the system performance while
   exploiting m-periodic scheduled access mechanism. First, various
   mobility patterns are generated with special emphasis on space and time
   varying links and their performance which are most vulnerable under
   dynamic environment. A deterministic pathloss values ( as an estimate of
   the channel) are obtained from a set of training sequence which is
   generated using motion capture system and bio-mechanical modeling.
   Consequently, signal to noise (SNR), bit error rate (BER) and packet
   error rate ( PER) are calculated. The TCA algorithm during the first
   phase uses this estimated PER to select the potential nodes for a time
   slot. Whereas in the second phase, based on the nodes priority and the
   data packets availability among the potential candidates, finally a slot
   is assigned to one node. This process is repeated by the coordinating
   node until the end of the super frame. This scheme has a significant
   gain over a reference scheme (i.e., without above adaptation). On
   average, 20-to-55 percent extra packets are received, along with 1-to-5
   joules of energy savings though at the cost of higher delay ranging from
   20-to-200 ms while operating at low power levels (i.e., 0 dBm, -5 dBm, -
   10 dBm).},

Abstract = {One of the prevalent method to achieve clock synchronization in star
   topology based wireless network, is by periodic transmission of a
   ``Beacon{''} message from the controller. Using this message other nodes
   locate the start of the time frame established by the controller. This
   technique has not been energy efficient in case of low duty cycle
   applications, where the nodes have to receive the Beacon at the start of
   every frame even when they don't have any data to transmit. Few of
   existing works solve this problem by introducing a larger fixed size
   guard time between the transmission slots allocated to the devices. This
   allows the devices to skip multiple Beacons and still transmit in their
   allocated time slot without any collision. In such methods amount of
   bandwidth which remain unutilized due to fixed guard time becomes a
   considerably large fraction of the total available bandwidth. In this
   paper, we propose a novel technique to allow the nodes to skip the
   Beacon for certain number of frames by introducing the concept called
   Variable Guard Time (VGT). The number of frames that a node can remain
   synchronized with the coordinator without receiving the Beacon depends
   upon the number of Guard Slots allocated to it. This is decided based
   upon factors like the node's energy saving requirement, the actual clock
   drift rate between the devices and the available bandwidth. Simulation
   results show that, in terms of bandwidth utilization, the proposed idea
   of VGT outperforms the traditional approach of fixed guard time scheme.},

Abstract = {Magneto-inductive (MI) wireless communications is an emerging subject
   with a rich set of applications, including local area networks for the
   Internet-of-Things, wireless body area networks, in-body and on-chip
   communications, and underwater and underground sensor networks as a
   low-cost alternative to radio frequency, acoustic or optical methods.
   Practical MI networks include multiple access channel (MAC) mechanisms
   for connecting a random number of coils without any specific topology or
   coil orientation assumptions covering both short and long ranges.
   However, there is not any information theoretical modeling of MI MAC
   (MIMAC) capacity of such universal networks with fully coupled frequency
   selective channel models and exact 3-D coupling model of circular coils
   instead of long range dipole approximations. In this paper, K-user MIMAC
   capacity is information theoretically modeled and analyzed, and two-user
   MIMACs are modeled with explicitly detailed channel responses,
   bandwidths and coupled thermal noise. K-user MIMAC capacity is achieved
   through Lagrangian solution with K-user water-filling optimization.
   Optimum orientations maximizing capacity and received power are
   theoretically analyzed, and numerically simulated for two-user MIMACs.
   Constructive gain and destructive interference mechanisms on MIMACs are
   introduced in comparison with the classical interference based
   approaches. The theoretical basis promises the utilization of MIMACs in
   5G architectures.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a novel energy-efficient MAC Protocol designed
   specifically for wireless body area sensor networks (WBASN) focused
   towards pervasive healthcare applications. Wireless body area networks
   consist of wireless sensor nodes attached to the human body to monitor
   vital signs such as body temperature, activity or heart-rate. The
   network adopts a master-slave architecture, where the body-worn slave
   node periodically sends sensor readings to a central master node. Unlike
   traditional peer-to-peer wireless sensor networks, the nodes in this
   biomedical WBASN are not deployed in an ad hoc fashion. Joining a
   network is centrally managed and all communications are single-hop. To
   reduce energy consumption, all the sensor nodes are in standby or sleep
   mode until the centrally assigned time slot. Once a node has joined a
   network, there is no possibility of collision within a cluster as all
   communication is initiated by the central node and is addressed uniquely
   to a slave node. To avoid collisions with nearby transmitters, a clear
   channel assessment algorithm based on standard listen-before-transmit
   (LBT) is used. To handle time slot overlaps, the novel concept of a
   wakeup fallback time is introduced. Using single-hop communication and
   centrally controlled sleep/wakeup times leads to significant energy
   reductions for this application compared to more `flexible' network MAC
   protocols such as 802.11 or Zigbee. With longer sleep times, the overall
   power consumption approaches the standby power. The protocol is
   implemented in hardware as part of the Sensium (TM) system-on-chip WBASN
   ASIC, in a 0.13um CMOs process.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive carrier sense multiple access
   scheme with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) to perform efficient and
   reliable data transfer with increased throughput across multiple
   coexisting wireless body area networks (BANs) in a tiered architecture.
   We investigate the proposed scheme using two distributed cross-layer
   optimized dynamic routing techniques, i.e., shortest path routing (SPR)
   and cooperative multi-path routing (CMR). The channel state information
   from the physical layer is passed on to the network layer using an
   adaptive cross-layer carrier sensing mechanism between the physical and
   MAC layer, which adjusts the carrier sense threshold (e.g., RSSI)
   periodically based on the slowly-varying channel condition. An
   open-access experimental dataset of `everyday' mixed-activities is used
   for analyzing the cross-layer optimization. Our proposed optimization
   using adaptive carrier sensing performs better than static carrier
   sensing with CSMA/CA as it reduces the continuous back-off duration and
   latency as well as significantly increases the throughput (in successful
   packets/s) by more than 50\%. Adaptive CSMA/CA also shows 20\% and 6\%
   improvement over a coordinated TDMA approach with higher duty cycle for
   throughput and spectral efficiency, respectively, and provides
   acceptable packet delivery ratio and outage probability with respect to
   SINR.},

Abstract = {Body area networks is an emerging field in the healthcare industry. The
   BAN for medical applications cover continuous waveform sampling of
   biomedical signals, monitoring of vital signal information, and low rate
   remote control of medical devices. In order to fulfill the diverse
   medical applications, these networks have to follow stringent technical
   requirements in terms of reliability (QoS), low power, data rate and
   noninterference. To meet these requirements, researchers have set up a
   task group 802.15.6 which is particularly working for BAN. Out of the
   available communication standards, IEEE 802.15.4 seems to be the nearest
   suitable candidate for MBAN. However the researchers have pointed out
   unsuitability of available 802.15.4 standard in terms of scalability and
   interference issues. This paper suggests modification in the MAC
   superframe structure of existing 802.15.4 and thereby addresses the
   scalability issue. The modified protocol is simulated for performance
   metrics such as throughput, power consumption, and delay. There is
   appreciable improvement in performance metrics with modified protocol
   thereby addressing the scalability issue.},

Abstract = {We investigate the performance of cross-layer optimized routing across
   distributed wireless body-to-body networks (BBNs), based on real-life
   experimental measurements. Two types of dynamic routing are analyzed:
   shortest path routing (SPR), and cooperative multi-path routing (CMR)
   associated with selection combining. An open-access experimental dataset
   incorporating `everyday' mixed-activities is used for analyzing and
   comparing the cross-layer optimized routing protocols with different
   wireless sensor network protocols, i.e., ORPL and LOADng, and also with
   a standard star topology routing within a BBN (multiple, connected, body
   area networks). Negligible packet error rate is achieved by applying CMR
   and SPR techniques with reasonably sensitive receivers. Moreover, at
   10\% outage probability, CMR gains up to 12, 8, 7, and 6 dB improvements
   over star topology routing, ORPL, SPR, and LOADng, respectively. We show
   that CMR achieves the highest throughput (packets/s) while providing
   acceptable end-to-end delay with 95 ms maximum, at -100 dBm receive
   sensitivity. The use of an alternate path in CMR reduces retransmissions
   and increases the packet success rate, which significantly reduces the
   end-to-end delay and energy consumption for CMR with respect to the
   other protocols. It is also shown that the combined channel gains across
   SPR and CMR are gamma and Rician distributed, respectively.},
